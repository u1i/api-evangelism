title: API Evangelist Branding Guidelines
---

<p>As my presence grows, I'm feeling the need to better protect the integrity of the API Evangelist brand, and in the world of APIs it is common for providers to have a branding guidelines page. Following the lead of API proviers I monitor, I have created this branding guidelines page to help you better understand how to positively use API Evangelist images.</p>
<p align="center" style="font-size:18px;"><strong>API Evangelist Logo</strong></p>
<p>Let's start with the official API Evangelist logo. Even though this logo was entirely by accident, the result of me having zero graphic design skills, it has become a significant part of my brand, and recognizable because of the t-shirts I wear when on the road. I do not mind if you print the logo on any t-shirt you desire.</p>

<p style="color: #000;" align="center"><strong>ACCEPTABLE USE OF API EVANGELIST LOGO!!</strong></p><br />
<p>However when you are wearing the API Evangelist logo, be respectful, and make sure the logo is always in clear sight of anyone that may be looking at you. Make sure your out of control hipster, or hippie beard does not block the logo at any point in time, even for a brief moment.</p>

<p style="color: #FF0000;" align="center"><strong>UNACCEPTABLE USE OF API EVANGELIST LOGO!!</strong></p><br />
<p>If you are printing any t-shirts using the API Evangelist logo, make sure that you print an equal amount of women sizes--nothing more annoying that making a girl wear a bro shirt!</p>

<p align="center" style="font-size:18px;"><strong>API Evangelist Image</strong></p>
<p>Now let's work with the image of me as the API Evangelist. I would have never commissioned something like this, but a talented fan in Paris drew it of me, and it has also become associated with my brand, used for a variety of online profiles, t-shirts, and stickers.</p>
<p>The API Evangelist image is perfect as a sticker, and can easily be applied to any of the places you enjoy putting stickers, such as your car, or possible on the front of your Macbook Pro!</p>

<p style="color: #000;" align="center"><strong>ACCEPTABLE USE OF API EVANGELIST IMAGE!!</strong></p><br />
<p>However when it is not acceptable to ever get a tattoo of API Evangelist image anywhere on your body, it would just be way to creepy for me, and just really sad, pathetic for you, that you would even do this. ;-(</p>

<p style="color: #FF0000;" align="center"><strong>UNACCEPTABLE USE OF API EVANGELIST IMAGE!!</strong></p><br />
<p>When it comes down to it, just make sure you use the API Evangelist logo, and image in sensible ways, that aren't going to make me look bad. I want you to help spread the good API word, but please don't make me look like an ass!!</p>
<p>I appreciate you helping protect my brand, and following all of the API Evangelist branding guidelines--thank you for your time!</p>
