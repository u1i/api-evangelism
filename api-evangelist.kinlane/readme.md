# Supporting API Evangelist

Did you spot something wrong, like a typo, broken link, or another type of mistake? [API Evangelist](apievangelist.com) is driven by GitHub, so feel free to fork, fix, and issue a pull request. I really appreciate your help editing my work, as a one-person shop.

Have an idea for a story? Anyone can submit stories to API Evangelistâ€”all you do is submit a pull request on the GitHub repo that runs the site. Obviously, stories have to meet Kin's standards, so be sure what you write fits with both the content and tone of the site, and be sure to note that you're making a guest post. It might help to be familiar with [Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/), and look in the posts directory for examples to follow. You can write in either HTML or Markdown, whichever is easiest for you.

You can visit the repositories for all of my API research under my Github organizaiton - https://github.com/api-evangelist/

Thanks for paying attention--it means a lot to me!
