<a href="http://www.twilio.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Twilio.PNG" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>The cloud communications platform <a href="http://blog.twilio.com/2011/02/anything-goes-developers-on-a-bus.html" target="_blank">Twilio has a new API developer contest this week</a>.<p></p>
As usual they are looking for someone to build a killer app that uses the Twilio voice and SMS API.<p></p>
This round they are looking for more, but first lets set the stage with the prizes:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>A guaranteed seat on either the Cleveland, or Miami SXSW Startup Bus</li>
	<li>A ticket to <a href="http://sxsw.com/interactive" target="_blank">SXSW Interactive</a>, valued at $750</li>
</ul>
In addition to building a killer app, they are looking for someone to tweet, blog, record video, and generally represent Twilio on the bus.<p></p>
Entries must be <a href="http://contests.twilio.com/submit-your-twilio-project.html" target="_blank">submitted</a> by 11:59pm PT on Sunday February 27th.
