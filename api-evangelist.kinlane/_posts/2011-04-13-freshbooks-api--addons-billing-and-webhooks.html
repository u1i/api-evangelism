At API Evangelist I'm focused on the business of APIs, with a minor focus on the technology behind those APIs.  So when I publish a business review of an API, I will add it to my API database, then move on.<p></p>
That is, unless I identify a story -- an innovative approach, monetization strategy, or anything that I feel needs to be talked about in more detail.<p></p>
While reviewing the <a title="Freshbooks API" href="http://developers.freshbooks.com/">Freshbooks API</a> I found three notable building blocks:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong><a title="Application Billing" href="http://developers.freshbooks.com/billing/">Application Billing</a></strong> - A built in billing and payment framework for Freshbook applications and beyond</li>
	<li><strong><a title="Webhooks" href="http://developers.freshbooks.com/webhooks/">Webhooks</a></strong> - Framework for enabling application callbacks, URLs where the Freshbook system can send notifications to third party applications</li>
	<li><a title="Freshbooks Add-On Store" href="http://community.freshbooks.com/addons/"><strong>FreshBooks Add-on Stor</strong>e</a> - Application store and development platform for developers to build custom apps, showcase,  and sell to Freshbook customers.</li>
</ul>
<a title="Self-Service Application Frameworks" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/anatomy-of-a-self-service-application-platforms/">Self-Service Application Frameworks</a> like the Freshbooks Add-On Store are growing more common.  I've talked about similar systems from <a title="Box.net" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/box-net-openbox/">Box.net</a> and <a title="Google Apps Marketplace" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/google-apps-marketplace/">Google Apps Marketplace</a>.  The Freshbooks Add-On store is not 100% self-service, but it is close.

Webhooks are nothing new, but Freshbook offers a standardized approach to deploying web-hooks that makes them easy for developer to use.<p></p>
A built in payment system is definitely a notable <a title="API Building Block" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks.php">API building block</a>.  Providing developers with a baked-in payment system for handling application monetization is very innovative.<p></p>
Where do these three building blocks fit into the big picture?   I try to build profiles for common API building blocks, I don't have profiles for self-service application frameworks, webhooks, and payment systems, but as I evaluate more I will define these as more innovative building blocks for API owners to use.<p></p>
I will definitely be keeping an eye on the <a title="Freshbook" href="http://www.freshbooks.com/">Freshbook</a> approach to their API.
