<p>For the last couple weeks I&rsquo;m neck deep in getting to know the developers who already use the <a title="CityGrid Developers" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/">CityGrid APIs</a>.  I want a better understanding of who a developer is, what kind of business they have and what they are looking to get out of the API.</p>
<p>To find this out I start out profiling them socially using <a title="Rapportive" href="http://rapportive.com/">Rapportive</a>&nbsp;(which I plan on automating using the&nbsp;<a title="Full Contact API" href="http://www.fullcontact.com/">Full Contact API</a> as soon as I have more time) for the following information:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Twitter Profile</li>
<li>LinkedIn Account</li>
<li>Facebook Profile</li>
<li>Google + Profile</li>
<li>Github Profile</li>
</ul>
<p>Usually I know the URL of their website, but if I don&rsquo;t, I can extract from their email address or sometimes Rapportive will provide for me. I visit each developer&rsquo;s site and look for:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Blog w/ RSS Feed</li>
<li>Business Contact Email </li>
<li>Business Contact Form</li>
</ul>
<p>Next I build a quick one sentence description, telling me who they are and what they do.  I also assemble a comma separated list of keyword and key phrases that best represent what they do.</p>
<p>Before I&rsquo;m done looking around their site I take a picture of their home page, so I have a visual reference to go with the developer profile. The home page image can go further than just a logo sometimes.</p>

<p>I take all of this information, put it into a database, and connected it to a JQuery Carousel that allows me to watch a slideshow that walks me through the world of my developers, and watch like a TV channel.</p>
<p>This process not only gives me a 100K understanding my developer ecosystem, but helps me remember as much as I can about each developer.  From this I hope to better engage them on a daily basis as well as provide feedback to the CityGrid API roadmap based upon quality API developer segmentation.</p>
