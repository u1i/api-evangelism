<p>Github just announced <a href="https://github.com/blog/1790-announcing-the-github-developer-program">a new developer program</a>, which will allow <a href="http://developer.github.com/v3/">Github API</a> developers to receive notifications about upcoming changes to the API, and get early access on some feature releases.</p>
<p>As part of the new developer program, you can also submit your work for inclusion on their <a href="https://github.com/integrations">integrations page</a>, which is essentially a showcase of the best Github integrations out there.</p>
<p>A beta program or refined developer group within your API ecosystem makes sense. Having an API access tier where the more engaged developers can step up, and play a closer role in the API roadmap, can bring some serious value to the table.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve blogged about the benefits of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/31/four-potential-levels-of-an-api-business-ecosystem/">multiple levels of API access</a> for a couple years now, and Github&rsquo;s approach shows their API ecosystem is maturing, and they are further formalizing the incubation of ideas, applications and partnerships within the Github API ecosystem.</p>
