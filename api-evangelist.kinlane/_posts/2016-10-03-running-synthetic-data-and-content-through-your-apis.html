<p>I was <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/organizations/">profiling the New Relic API</a> and came across their <a href="https://newrelic.com/synthetics">Synthetics service</a>,which is a testing and monitoring solution that lets you&nbsp;"s<span>end calls to your APIs to make sure each output and system response are successfully returned from multiple locations around the world"--pretty straight forward monitoring stuff. The name is what caught my attention, and got me thinking the data and content that we run through our APIs.</span></p>
<p>Virtualization feels like it defines the levers and gears our API-driven systems, and synthetics feels like it speaks to the data and content that flows through&nbsp;flows through these systems. It feels like everything in the API stack should be able to be virtualized, and sandboxes, including the data and content, which is the lifeblood--allowing us to test&nbsp;and monitor everything.</p>
<p>It also seems like another reason we'd want to share our data schemas, as well as employ common ones like <a href="http://schema.org/">schema.org</a>, so that others can create synthetic data and content sets for variety of scenarios--then API providers could put these sets to work in testing and monitoring their operations. A sort of synthetic data and content marketplace for the growing world of API testing and monitoring.</p>
<p>I see that New Relic has the name Synthetics trademarked, so I'll have to play around with variations to describe the data and the content portion of <a href="http://virtualization.apievangelist.com/">my API virtualization research</a>. I'll use virtualization to describe gears of the engine, and something along the lines of synthetic data and content to describe everything that we run through it. I am just looking for ways to better describe the different approaches I am seeing, and tell more stories about API virtualization, and sandboxing in ways that resonate with folks.</p>
