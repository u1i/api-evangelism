<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/" target="_blank"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/AWS_LOGO_CMYK.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a><a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2011/01/aws-premium-support-lower-prices-and-new-plans.html" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services (AWS) changed up its premium support offerings</a>, introducing two new support plans:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/"><strong>Bronze Plan</strong></a> - The Bronze Plan is meant for developers at $49.00 / month.</li>
	<li><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/"><strong>Platinum Plan</strong></a> - The Platinum Plan is meant for enterprise customers is 10% of AWS usage with a 15K monthly minimum.</li>
</ul>
In addition to the two new support plans AWS reduced the usage-based pricing for the Silver and gold plans by 50%.<p></p>
If  that wasn't enough, Amazon increased its responsiveness for normal  severity support cases from 24 business hours to 12 business hours, and  low severity cases from 48 to 24 hours.<p></p>
<a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=202" target="_blank">Premium Support</a> is a must-have building block in this API economy. But as  AWS's new offerings makes clear, as this becomes a competitive space -  in terms of quality and pricing - offering premium support might be the  thing that makes the difference for customers.
