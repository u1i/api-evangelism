<p><a href="http://www.3scale.net/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/3scale-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>At Mimeo, my API developers were running into problems integrating with our cloud print API, I needed a fast way to virtualize and deploy an API built on top of my existing REST API. &nbsp;A quick and dirty way I could research and develop new APIs, launch, measure and manage without getting IT involved. &nbsp;<br /><br /><span>So I <a title="virtualized four document APIs" href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/09/05/virtualized-document-printing-apis/">virtualized four document APIs</a> using the <a title="CodeIgniter" href="http://codeigniter.com/">CodeIgniter open-source PHP web framework</a>, <a title="Amazon EC2" href="http://apievangelist.com/apis/amazon_ec2.php">Amazon EC2</a>, <a title="3Scale API Management Service" href="http://www.3scale.net">3Scale self-service API management service</a> and <a title="Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API" href="http://developer.mimeo.com">Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API</a>.</span><br /><br /><span>First I launched a copy of the CodeIgniter framework on my existing Amazon EC2 instance, configured mod_rewrite to handle my URLs, and wrote seven API methods dedicated to printing just one type of document, like a poster. &nbsp;I now had a simple RESTful API that handled requests, and returned XML and JSON responses.</span><br /><br /><span><a href="http://codeigniter.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-tools/codeigniter-logo.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>I need a quick way to manage access to my API and measure its usage. &nbsp;So I would know who was using it, how they were using it, and if it was worth while to keep the API and put more resources into it. &nbsp;I selected <a title="3Scale API Management" href="http://apievangelist.com/serviceproviders/3scale.php">3Scale API management</a>, one of two free, self-service API mangement platforms out there. &nbsp;The other is <a title="Mashape" href="http://apievangelist.com/serviceproviders/mashape.php">Mashape</a>, but they are still in BETA, so 3Scale was the only other solution I could deploy for free, and scale as I needed when things were successful.</span><br /><br /><span>I deployed the 3Scale PHP connector on my Amazon EC2 instance as part of the CodeIgniter REST framework. &nbsp;I then launched my 3Scale self-service API area, which provides me with:</span></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Self-Service Developer Registration / Login / Key Management</li>
<li>Documentation</li>
<li>Forum &amp; Support</li>
<li>API Metering / Billing&nbsp;</li>
<li>Analytics and API Usage Reporting</li>
</ul>
<p><span>I now had a simple RESTful API, that had self-service documentation, app key registration, forum, and support. &nbsp;I received emails when new developers registered, could track how much they used, and turn off access when needed.</span><br /><br /><span>I was open for business, using the CodeIgniter tools as a RESTful framework and 3Scale as API management solution I was able to deploy and manage my APIs on an existing Amazon EC2 instance for free, with minimal work, and the platform will scale as my APIs get more usage.</span></p>
