<p><em>After looking back at 2012, I wanted a January 1, 2013 blog post for my blogs.  My first blog post of 2012 was my tour schedule for January, 2012.  While it was a pretty busy time for evangelizing and hackathons, I wanted something a little deeper.  I&rsquo;m not sure what, but I will play with the format year to year, until I find what I&rsquo;m looking for.</em></p>
<p><em>Every year I rewrite my bio, based upon where I am.  I&rsquo;ve been doing this since 2009.   This year I will write inaugural blog posts along with my bio rework, and post to each of my active blogs.  We&rsquo;ll see if it resonates again in 12 months and I do it again in 2014.</em></p>

<p>I started API Voice because I believe the politics of APIs is one of the most important areas that will make or break the API space.  APIs are not just technical.  There are a wide range of political issues facing companies when it comes to APIs.</p>
<p>The politics of APIs can range from terms of service issues to potential government regulation.  We are seeing the politics of APIs play out in the Twitter ecosystem and in the U.S. legal system with Oracle vs. Google.</p>
<p>My understanding of the politics of APIs still evolving.  I started API Voice in May 2012 to help me understand it more.  I&rsquo;m still trying to quantify all the areas, but so far the politics of APIs can include terms of use, data portability, branding, privacy, business models, service level agreements (SLA), acquisitions, copyright, regulation, patent and the ubiquitous, magical term &ldquo;open&rdquo;.</p>
<p>When I started <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, I wanted to provide a platform for research into the business of APIs.  Over two years I&rsquo;ve begun to solidify some perspective on the space, and form clear opinions around potential best practices.  With API Voice, I want to do the same for the politics of APIs.</p>
<p>At this point, all I can do is write about things as they unfold--as APIs are acquired and as they make the terms of service changes that impact developers.  API Voice is in its infancy, and I will be working to cover as many of what unfolds in 2013 as I can.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t help but feel that 2013 is going to be a big year when it comes to the politics of APIs.</p>
