<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/google/Google-Plus-Platform-Blog-1.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />Google just put up a new <a title="Google+ Platform Blog" href="http://googleplusplatform.blogspot.com/">Google+ Platform blog</a> today, to support the growing demand around their new social platform.<p></p>
Developers have been waiting for the release of the Google+ API, so they can get to work building Google+ applications. While Google did put up a<a title="Google+ developers signup form" href="https://services.google.com/fb/forms/plusdevelopers/">Google+ developers signup form</a>, there has been no other word about access to the Google+ APIs.<p></p>
Apparently, todays launch of games on Google+ represents the first wave of developers using the Google+ APIs. Google chose to release the Google+ API to a small number of gaming partners so they could experiment, gather feedback and work the kinks out of the Google+ APIs before releasing it into the wild.<p></p>
It shows they are starting to allow developers into the Google+ APIs, but I am sure they are prioritizing their partners, and unless your a Zynga or a Popcap, I doubt you'll get early access.<p></p>
It seems wise of Google to open up access to game developers first, after the major success of the Facebook API platform was around gaming.
