<p>BaaS stacks have the potential to be the operating of the next generation of computing. BaaS has a lot of the characteristics of what we have historically defined as an OS, but tailored for apps that run on devices and in the clouds vs the desktop.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Windows OS -&nbsp;</strong>Think of what the Windows operating system did for computing. It brought together a meaningful stack of resources into a single stack that could be installed on the new world of personal computers (PC). &nbsp;Windows provided application developers with a single platform they could build apps, targeting PC users. &nbsp;Windows provided a basic set of API resources developers could use, but ultimately it was open for the ecosystem to innovate in any business sector they desired.</li>
<li><strong>Server OS -&nbsp;</strong>When it comes to the server, many developers have migrated from desktop to web via Windows server operating systems. &nbsp;While to others they think of other OS flavors like Linux, BSD. &nbsp;These server environments provide developers with a base operating system for interfacing with user management, file system, database access and other libraries or APIs to develop either server side, network or web applications. &nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Cloud (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) -&nbsp;</strong>Cloud providers have moved the OS into the clouds--enabling developers to build at three different levels, providing a base OS, with set of often API driven resources for delivering site and apps to end users. &nbsp;The operating system has moved onto the world wide web, allowing for an entirely different approach to application development, usage and monetization.</li>
<li><strong>Virtualized BaaS OS -&nbsp;</strong>BaaS isn't just a new type of business. &nbsp;BaaS is a new way to deliver operating systems tailored for mobile and the next generation of devices, sensors and the Internet of Things. &nbsp;BaaS delivers the compute, storage, messaging and other essential OS features, while also bringing together other, potentially distributed resources in a single meaningful system for mobile developers to operate on and provide a meaningful experience for their users.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using BaaS, providers can deliver virtualized operating system stacks, for general purposes, much like Windows has served for decades or deliver specialized operating systems meant specifically for telco or healthcare. &nbsp;Imagine virtualized OS stacks that could be delivered to support fixed installations like the energy grid or telco installations, all the way to temporary, high demand situations like disaster recovery or large scale events.</p>
<p>BaaS will allow us to keep much of the potential delivered by a hardened set of resources we become accustomed to with desktop and server OS's, but also realize the agility and flexibility that is delivered by loosely coupled, individual API resources. &nbsp;Allowing for a new approach to app design, development, deployment and life-cycle management that is much more organic and alive.</p>
