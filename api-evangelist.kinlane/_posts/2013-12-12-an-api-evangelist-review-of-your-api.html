<p>Over the last 3 years I have looked at all the APIs available in <a href="https://bitly.com/10rGRbg+">ProgrammableWeb API directory</a>, with about 2500 of which I monitor regularly. Throughout this process I've evolved an eye for what building blocks go into a successful API program.</p>
<p>When I review an existing API area or program, public or private, I spend as little or as much time as I need to look at an API initiative through the following 20 lenses:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview</strong>&nbsp;- The general look, feel and initial impression of an API at the high level.</li>
<li><strong>Endpoints</strong>&nbsp;- Review of API endpoints, looking at the detail.</li>
<li><strong>On-boarding</strong>&nbsp;- How easy is it to get up and going? Where is the friction?</li>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong>&nbsp;- General API documentation review and critique.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication</strong>&nbsp;- What is involved with authentication and security.</li>
<li><strong>Code</strong>&nbsp;- A look at all available code libraries, SDKs, apps and language or platform availability.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile</strong>&nbsp;- Is there a mobile fit and how does an API address this world.</li>
<li><strong>Support</strong>&nbsp;- What do direct and indirect support practices look like and what are activity levels.</li>
<li><strong>Communications</strong>&nbsp;- How are communications handled, and is it done in a transparent way.</li>
<li><strong>Change Practices</strong>&nbsp;- How are updates, changes, and communication around the roadmap handled.</li>
<li><strong>Business Model</strong>&nbsp;- What is the business model of an API, how does it make ends meet.</li>
<li><strong>Resources</strong>&nbsp;- What resources are provided from how-to, case studies to videos and workshops.</li>
<li><strong>Research &amp; Development</strong>&nbsp;- Does an API reflect a research &amp; development group.</li>
<li><strong>Legal Department&nbsp;</strong>- Covering the legal areas of terms of use, privacy and branding.</li>
<li><strong>Embeddable</strong>&nbsp;- How portable and embeddable are aspects of the API? Can it be distributed easily?</li>
<li><strong>Environment</strong>&nbsp;- A look at the underlying environment of the API, sandboxing, testing, monitoring, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Developers</strong>&nbsp;- What does this look like for a developer? What tools do we get to ensure success?</li>
<li><strong>Consistency</strong>&nbsp;- How consistent are API endpoints and the support resources, and the overall operations.</li>
<li><strong>Openness</strong>&nbsp;- If the API is public, to what degree of open are API efforts?&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Evangelism</strong>&nbsp;- What does outreach around the API look like, regarding events, social, storytelling, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can look across the&nbsp;<a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html" target="_blank">building blocks I have listed for API management</a>&nbsp;to get a better idea of the detail I'm looking for across API operations. These building blocks have been assembled through over 3 years of reviewing APIs, and can provide a good checklist to use when applying the above lenses.</p>
<p>Each review involves visiting an API area, applying the above 20 lenses, register and often times hack on an API. When done I write up a review report, which in many cases will be privately shared with a company and key&nbsp;stakeholders&nbsp;for review and discussion.</p>
<p>In some cases, when approved, I will publicly write up a review, providing a more polished view of an API area based upon final review report, and publish on my API Evangelist network of blogs.</p>
<p>The goal with a review is to better understand the balance of technology, business and politics going on within an API ecosystem, providing feedback that will help a company better achieve balance and success with their API initiative.</p>
