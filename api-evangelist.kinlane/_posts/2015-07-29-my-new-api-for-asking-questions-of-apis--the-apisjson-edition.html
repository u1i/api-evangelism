<p>I am currently trying to move forward the&nbsp;<a href="http://theapistack.com/">917 companies, from 223 business areas, with a total 882 APIs catalogued, and 407 Swagger definitions created</a>, while working on a distributed way to understand where the profiling for each company is, and how far in defining this in a machine readable way. <a href="http://api-questions.apievangelist.com/">I had kicked off another prototype APIs.json type a few months back I'm calling api-questions to handle just this</a>, in a way that allows me to ask human readable questions about APis, while also storing in a distributed, machine readable format that can be indexed via each APIs.json file.</p>
<p>I have long tracked on what public APIs are doing in a database. I keep links to Github and Twitter profiles, blogs to pricing, and terms of service. I started publishing this information to APIs.json for the companies I track on a while back. I have the information, and I'm working my way through thousands of APIs, trying to make sure there is a complete definition available, I needed an automated way to help make sure I'm asking the right quesitons consistently of each API.</p>
<p>So, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/09/my-new-api-for-asking-questions-of-apis--the-swagger-edition/">in addition to my list of Swagger oriented questions</a>, I've compiled a list of the most common APIs.json defined, API operations related questions that I ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there an API? (the most important question of them all!)</li>
<li>Is there an APIs.json File?</li>
<li>Is there a blog?</li>
<li>Is there a blog RSS feed?</li>
<li>Is there a portal?</li>
<li>Is there a platform description?</li>
<li>Is there getting started information?</li>
<li>Is there documentation for the API?</li>
<li>Is there interactive documentation for the API?</li>
<li>Is there an authentication overview?</li>
<li>Is there self-service registration?</li>
<li>Is there request for access?</li>
<li>Is there code samples?</li>
<li>Is there code libraries?</li>
<li>Is there SDKs?</li>
<li>Is there email for support?</li>
<li>Is there an FAQ section?</li>
<li>Is there a knowledge base?</li>
<li>Is there a forum?</li>
<li>Is there a Twitter account?</li>
<li>Is there a LinkedIn account?</li>
<li>Is there a Github account?</li>
<li>Is there a pricing page?</li>
<li>Is there a rate limit page?</li>
<li>Is there a road map?</li>
<li>Is there a change log?</li>
<li>Is there a status page?</li>
<li>Is there a terms of service?</li>
<li>Is there a privacy policy?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help me along, I've created a <a href="http://question.api.kinlane.com/questions/">simple API for management of my API related questions</a>, then I created <a href="http://question.api.kinlane.com/questions/ask/organization/?apisjson_url=https://kin-lane.github.io/api/apis.json&amp;questions=19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45">another API for asking these questions of specific APIs.json files</a>. However if you want to use this API, you need an <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> index for your APIs, which all of mine in the API stack do--then it will spider and do its best to answer the &nbsp;questions above, and return specific answers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The results are far from perfect, but it is a start. I will be making the questions more precise, and adding new questions. My goal is to have a real-time way of telling how complete my APIs.json files are, and where the work is that needs to be done--as I am doing the work.</p>
<p>I'm sure the definition of exactly what is a complete APIs.json definition is will continue to evolve, always resulting in a human having the final vote, but for now I will just keep defining, until I find the right balance between programmatic, and the human touch.</p>
