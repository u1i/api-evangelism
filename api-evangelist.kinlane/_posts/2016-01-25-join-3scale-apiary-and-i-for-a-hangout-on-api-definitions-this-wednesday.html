<p>Join me, Steve Willmott(<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>) of <a href="http://apis.how/ake3nxbapm">3Scale</a>, and Jakub Nesetril(<a href="https://twitter.com/jakubnesetril">@jakubnesetril</a>) of <a href="http://apis.how/ohgw3uqjt0">Apiary</a>, for a hangout on API definitions this week. I wanted to explore&nbsp; doing more hangouts under the APIStrat, as well as API Evangelist brand(s)--for this one I wanted to bring together some experts to talk about the fast moving world of API definitions, as a <a href="http://hangoutwith.apievangelist.com/">Hangout with API Evangelist</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://hangouts.apistrat.com/">This Wednesday, January 27th, at 11:00 AM PST, the three of us will jump on a Google Hangout</a>, and you are welcome to join in the conversation. We will be doing the gathering as a Hangout on Air, so that you can ask questions if you want, joining in the live conversation, or you can wait until after we are done, I will make sure and publish the video to Youtube.</p>

<p>Its a pretty important time for API definitions with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/">the Swagger specification reborn as the OpenAPISpec</a>, and Apiary, the creator of API Blueprint and MSON, <a href="http://blog.apiary.io/2016/01/18/We-ve-got-Swagger/">also adopting OpenAPI Spec this last week, allowing you to design and mock your API in both formats</a>. 3Scale was an earlier adopter of Swagger, and <a href="http://www.3scale.net/tag/swagger/">has taken a leadership position in shepherding it to into the Linux Foundation, and is a member of the governance working group</a>.</p>
<p>I figured that it is a pretty good time to check-in with Steve and Jakub, on the current state of API definitions, and how they see them impacting their own platforms, as well as the overall API space. If you have any specific questions you'd like me to ask, or have any specific topics you'd like to see discussed, feel free to tweet at me. <a href="http://hangoutwith.apievangelist.com">I'll tweet out the link for the event, but all you need to do is visit hangoutwith.apievangelist.com, this Wednesday at 11:00 PST, and join in the conversation</a>.</p>
