<p>While I was in France, the art director at <a href="http://www.fabernovel.com/en/">Faber Novel</a> did some cool sketches of me. &nbsp;Since I'm so graphically challenged (see my logo), I'm stoked to have the artwork to work with.</p>
<p>I've been playing around with different versions of it, combine with different messages. &nbsp;Here is my first one.</p>
