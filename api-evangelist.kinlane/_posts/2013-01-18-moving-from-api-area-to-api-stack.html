<p>Finding APIs that compliment your API, and talking about the mutual benefits is nothing new.  When I worked with the <a href="http://mimeo.com">print API Mimeo</a>, I would write code that used Mimeo API in conjunction with <a title="Box API" href="http://developer.mimeo.com/blog/blog_detail.php?ID=91">Box API</a> or <a href="http://developer.mimeo.com/blog/blog_detail.php?ID=223">Dropbox API</a>.  Mashing up or bundling your APIs with other complimentary service can really help, when you are trying to explain the value your API delivers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m beginning to see patterns of even deeper integration and partnerships between APIs emerge--where one API provider will resell the API of another provider. &nbsp;APIs partnering with other APIs isn&rsquo;t that new, but reselling of each others API services to their developers is a fairly new concept, providing a potential new wholesale channel for API providers.</p>
<p>One recent example of this is in a recent <a title="partnership between Singly and Cloudmine" href="http://blog.singly.com/2012/11/12/teaming-up-with-cloudmine-for-backend-superpowers/">partnership between Singly and Cloudmine</a>.  Cloudmine is a <a title="BaaS Provider" href="/trends/baas.php">BaaS provider</a>, and Singly is provider of personal and social data via <a title="aggregate APIs" href="/trends/aggregation.php">aggregate APIs</a>. With the reseller approach, Cloudmine developers get a vastly improved stack to develop against, with <a href="https://cloudmine.me/">Cloudmine</a> providing all the essential BaaS tools developers are growing accustomed to, while also having access to 30+ social, personal and other aggregate API services provide by <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a>.</p>
<p>The goal of this new approach is to provide developers with the most meaningful stack possible, in a single developer area.   A <a href="http://www.mogreet.com/">MMS API provider like Mogreet</a> could in theory, to better serve their developers, bundle image APIs like Flickr, Instagram and Facebook from Singly into their API area--providing a more robust stack to their developers who are building media enabled mobile apps.</p>
<p>Now developers don&rsquo;t have to traverse to each API area on their own.  APIs can mashup, bundle and develop a stack, which includes their own APIs, but might also have APIs from potentially several other API providers. &nbsp; Obviously there are lots of details to work out around authentication, pricing, etc., but the potential is obvious.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also talking with a linguistics API provider in Europe, and learning more about their partner program, which would allow for 3rd party API providers to submit APIs and sell alongside their own linguistics API. &nbsp;Opening up their API stack for new opportunities and innovation from 3rd party linguistics API providers--in languages, formats they wouldn't have resources to do themselves.</p>
<p>As the number of APIs are growing, and we are seeing APIs aggregate via providers like Singly and through BaaS providers like Cloudmine, I think we&rsquo;ll see individual APIs become more portable, allowing them to be assembled into meaningful API stacks for developers. &nbsp;</p>
