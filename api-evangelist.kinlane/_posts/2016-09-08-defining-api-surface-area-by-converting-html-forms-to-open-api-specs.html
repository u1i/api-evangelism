<p>I'm investing some time learning about the <a href="http://waterservices.usgs.gov/">USGS Water Services</a>. They have some pretty interesting APIs, providing access to a wealth of data about water table levels, river flows, and other key points across all USGS sites. While their developer area has a wealth of information available, it is also pretty verbose and tough to absorb.</p>
<p>I wanted to help make the information more accessible, filterable, and remixable by turning it into an OpenAPI Spec. It is A LOT OF WORK to craft a complete OpenAPI Spec for a robust API like the six that are available from the USGS. One way I help alleviate this work is to scrape API documentation. As I was preparing to do this I noticed they also have testing tools for 5 out of the 6 APIs, which are just HTML forms containing a definition of the surface area for each API.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/IV-Test-Tool.html">Instantaneous Values (IV) Web Service</a></li>
<li><a href="http://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/Site-Test-Tool.html">Site Service</a></li>
<li><a href="http://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/DV-Test-Tool.html">Daily Values (DV) Web Service</a></li>
<li><a href="http://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/GW-Levels-Test-Tool.html">Groundwater Levels Web Service</a></li>
<li><a href="http://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/Statistics-Service-Test-Tool.html">Statistics Web Service</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The HTML forms provide me with a slightly more structured definition of each API so I will start here. Once I've ingested these, I will write a scrape script for the HTML API documentation, and link the two up. Once I'm done with this I will be able to generate an OpenAPI Spec that is halfway complete (with just the surface area). Once I have this I can load up in my Postman client, turn on Charles Proxy and my internal API monitoring system will fill in the remaining definitions for the Open API Spec--now I have the request and response model, in a machine readable format.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I write the code to tackle this, I'm thinking about what a great approach HTML forms are to helping both technical, and semi-technical HTML craftspeople define the surface area of an API. Then I think about my friend Mike Amundsen (<a href="https://twitter.com/mamund">@mamund</a>) and <a href="http://alps.io/">his work on ALPS</a>, and I smile, and I'm reminded of how much work we have ahead of us when it comes to both <a href="http://webconcepts.info/">web literacy</a> and <a href="https://github.com/alps-io/profiles">establishing more meaningful, reusable design patterns across the API space</a>(that repo should be full).</p>
<p><em><strong>P.S.</strong> Is there a better tool out there for turning HTML Forms into OpenAPI Spec or at least JSON or YAML?<br /></em><em><strong>P.S.S.</strong> If you wanna create an API that I can pass any web page with a form in it, and get back an OpenAPI Spec, you are a good person.</em></p>
