<p>I&rsquo;m not at Google I/O this week, enjoying some downtime in SoCal, but I am watching some of the news coming out of the event. One thing I noticed, was the addition of monitoring to the <a href="https://console.developers.google.com">Google Developer Console</a>, where&nbsp;Google is slowly working their <a href="https://www.stackdriver.com">StackDriver acquisition</a> into their fast growing API driven, cloud development platform.</p>
<p>You have to request access to the new monitoring services, and Google will open up "Stackdriver's monitoring capabilities available to select Google Cloud trusted testers at no charge&rdquo;. Wile Stackdriver is about monitoring your cloud infrastructure, it also provides <a href="http://www.stackdriver.com/announcing-endpoint-monitoring/">granular level, API endpoint monitoring solutions</a> that you can use to monitor the health of the API resources you depend on in your apps.</p>
<p>When Google makes a move to support a specific feature across its world of APIs, I take notice. Much like when <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/03/14/google-api-access-with-oauth-20/">Google adopted OAuth 2.0 across all APIs</a>, I think their move to provide monitoring services, is a sign that monitoring of the resources you depend is going mainstream--something all web, mobile and Iot API resource providers need to have in place by default in 2014.</p>
