<p>If you aren&rsquo;t already familiar with <a href="http://trafficandweather.io/">Traffic and Weather</a>, it is an extremely structured discussion between <strong><a href="http://twitter.com/johnsheehan">John Sheehan</a></strong><span>&nbsp;(</span><a href="https://www.runscope.com/">Runscope</a><span>) and&nbsp;</span><strong><a href="http://twitter.com/smarx">Steve Marx</a></strong><span>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/developers">Dropbox</a></span><span id="yui_3_10_1_1_1397679765949_2166">)</span>, about "the latest API and cloud tools, news and technologies&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Its not often I learn something new from the show (kidding), but today I learned about two new things:</p>

<td><a href="http://flask-restful.readthedocs.org/en/latest/"><strong>Flask RESTful</strong> </a>- Flask-RESTful is an extension for Flask that adds support for quickly building REST APIs. It is a lightweight abstraction that works with your existing ORM/libraries. Flask-RESTful encourages best practices with minimal setup. If you are familiar with Flask, Flask-RESTful should be easy to pick up.</td>

<p>Its nice to hear more discussion about the evolution of deploying API resources and micro services, and the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/07/containers-will-do-for-apis-what-apis-do-for-companies/">use of virtual containers from Docker, OpenShift and Cloud Formations</a>&mdash;especially since its a topic <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/02/01/traffic-and-weather--virtualized-api-stacks/">Traffic and Weather and API Evangelist have discussed before</a>. ;-)</p>
<p>Seriously though, they put on a good show, forward thinking API conversation, with lots of humor and not-so-funny humor mixed in. I always recommend listening when you have time, you might learn a thing or two about APIs along the way.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Tip: If it sounds like the show is almost over, it is. Turn off the podcast.</em></p>
