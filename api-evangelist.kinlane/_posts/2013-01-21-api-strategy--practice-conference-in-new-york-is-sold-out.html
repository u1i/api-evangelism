<p>It is 30 days until the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/" target="_blank">API Strategy &amp; Practice conference in New York City</a>,&nbsp;February 21st and 22nd, and the event is now sold out!</p>
<p>The event will be a 275 person conference focused on discussing the API industry.</p>
<p>Since the event was postponed after Hurricane Sandy, the demand to get in and speak was overwhelming and conference tickets didn&rsquo;t last long either.</p>
<p>We were able to keep almost all the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/sessions.php">original session lineup</a> while make a couple changes and squeezing in a couple new speakers, where possible.</p>
<p>I am really pleased with how the event has come together.  We have an amazing lineup and from looking at the attendee list, it looks like it will be a diverse groups of folks in attendance, discussing APIs.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing you all in New York!</p>
