<a href="http://www.stackapps.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/stack-overflow/Stack-Apps-Registration.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" /></a>You want to make it as easy as possible for developers to get up and running with your <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">API</a>.<p></p>
You don't want developers to fumble around with lengthy registrations and approval processes.<p></p>
Your API registration needs to be simple and self-service. <a href="http://openid.net" target="_blank">OpenID</a> is one way to do this.<p></p>
<a href="http://stackapps.com">StackApps</a>, the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> API demonstrates this perfectly.<p></p>
I wanted to see what was possible using the Stack Apps API. My objective is to integrate an API FAQ system with a Stack Overflow site.<p></p>
I went to Stack Apps and clicked on registration. Stack Apps only gives OpenID for registration. They allow you to select from top providers like <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/google/">Google</a> and <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/facebook/">Facebook</a> or use your own OpenID provider.<p></p>
With two clicks I was registered for a Stack Apps developer account, and with one more click I was registering my <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/application/">Application</a> and getting my keys.<p></p>
This is how easy you want to make it for developers to get up and going developing against your API. OpenID is the solution.
