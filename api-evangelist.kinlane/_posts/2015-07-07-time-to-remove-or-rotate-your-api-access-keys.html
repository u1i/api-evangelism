<p>I got an email from <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> this morning, regarding a set of API keys I setup a while back, for a prototype I was building. The project was over a year ago, and the keys have not been evolved, and managed like I do with the rest of my regularly used AWS API keys.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the email I received:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>We noticed that your account contains root access keys that are more than 1 year old. As a security best practice, AWS recommends removing your root access keys entirely and using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) instead. At a minimum we recommend rotating access keys regularly or removing access keys if they are no longer in use.&nbsp;</em><br /><br /><em>To help you determine whether your access keys are safe to rotate or delete, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) now reports the time stamp&nbsp;when access keys for an IAM user or root account were last used, along with the region and the AWS service that was accessed. These details complement&nbsp;password last used&nbsp;data to provide a more thorough picture of when an IAM user or root account was last active.&nbsp;</em><br /><br /><em>To view your root access keys and when they were last used, go to the&nbsp;security credentials page&nbsp;in the AWS Management Console. After you have located the old keys, rotate or delete them by using&nbsp;these steps. Note that you can also view the access keys of an IAM user in the&nbsp;IAM console&nbsp;or see a snapshot of all the access keys in your AWS account by downloading an&nbsp;IAM credential report.</em><br /><br /><em>To learn more, read&nbsp;Best Practices for Managing AWS Access Keys&nbsp;in the AWS documentation.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>I like the fact that they notify me about keys like this, and they provide me with links to resources where I can management my API keys, see when they were last used, and also provide access to best practices around key management.</p>
<p>I am in a unique spot, because I sign up for hundreds of API keys, to test out the services I talk about, so management of my API keys gets pretty unwieldy. This is something I'm working on as part of my <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json work</a>, and something I'm hoping to share with others, as key management is both an API provider, and an API consumer problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/16/with-number-of-apis-continuing-to-grow-account-automation-will-be-key/">Along with other suggestions like the automation of account, app, and key management by providing an API</a>, I will track on approaches like what AWS is doing, and try to <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">standardize as common building blocks</a>, to help API providers (and consumers) better secure their platforms, through sensible API key management approaches.</p>
