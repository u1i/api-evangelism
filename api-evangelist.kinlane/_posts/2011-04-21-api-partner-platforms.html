As an <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://www.apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> I'm always grouping and targeting my API consumers, to better meet their needs and identify their role within my <a title="API Ecosystem" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem.php">API ecosystem</a>.
<p></p>The three main groups that I break my API users into, are:<img src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?chs=300x225&amp;cht=p3&amp;chd=s:SSMG&amp;chdl=Partner|Public|Inernal|Platform&amp;chdlp=b&amp;chma=1,1,1,1&amp;chtt=API+Ecosystem&amp;chts=000000,14" alt="API Ecosystem" width="300" height="225" align="right" />
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Partners Developers
     </li>
     <li>Public Developers
     </li>
     <li>Internal Developers
     </li>
</ul>When I first started working with APIs, I generally focused on API access for partners.
<p></p>With the introduction of Open APIs, I began paying attention to a wider audience of developers from different countries, industries, programming languages and platforms.
<p></p>Recently APIs are also being recognized for their use internally. API owners often target other departments or business locations when deploying or consuming APIs.
<p></p>As the API Evangelist for <a title="Mimeo.com" href="http://www.mimeo.com">Mimeo.com</a>, I'm seeing a new target emerge, platform partners.
<p></p>Platform partners are tend to be other complimentary APIs and / or <a title="self-service application platforms" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/anatomy-of-a-self-service-application-platforms/">self-service application platforms</a> like <a title="Box.net" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/box-net-openbox/">Box.net</a> and <a title="Google Apps Marketplace" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/google-apps-marketplace/">Google Apps Marketplace</a>.
<p></p>Just like with my partners, public, and internal developers I'm developing specific strategies, code samples, documentation and other tools targeting my designated partner platforms.
<p></p>Partner platforms are quickly becoming an important part of my API ecosystem, we'll see where this trend goes.
