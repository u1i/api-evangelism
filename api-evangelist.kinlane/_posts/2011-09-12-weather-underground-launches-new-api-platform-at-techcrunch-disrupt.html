     <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/weather-underground/Weather-Underground-weather-api-logo.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>At <a href="http://disrupt.techcrunch.com">TechCrunch DISRUPT</a>, this week in San Francisco, the <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/">Weather Underground</a> launched a new Weather API platform that provides developers with real-time access to in-depth weather data.
</p>
<p>
     The <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/">Weather Underground Weather API</a> provides access to data from more than 19,000 users contributing local observations from personal weather stations, providing up-to-the-minute weather conditions for the most finely targeted areas.
</p>
<p>
     The Weather API is RESTful with responses available in a JSON format, with access free for developers making 500 requests per day, and paid tiers for requests starting at 5K requests per month up to 1M requests per month.
</p>
<p>

"Our new self-service API platform will open up our data to thousands more developers working on web and mobile programs, big and small."
</p>
<p>
     The Weather Underground provides a very robust developers area allowing developers to signup, manage their keys and choose the appropriate pricing plan. They provide the necessary API documentation and code samples to get up and going, and even throw in some analytics showing your access and usage of the API.
