<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/3D-Printing/3d-printing-delivery.jpg" alt="" width="175" align="right" />3D printing is about delivering a virtual object as a physical object, on demand.</p>
<p>This is where our current shipping industry steps in;  UPS, Fedex, USPS, DHS and other shipping providers will make sure we receive our 3D printed objects.</p>
<p>With growing fuel costs, the need for localized delivery will grow, and here is another area where 3D printing will excel.</p>
<p><a title="3D Printers" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printers-printers/">3D printers</a> can be localized and deliver parts and products locally, with only the need to ship raw materials.</p>
<p>As the green revolution continues, 3D printing will become a key player providing localized manufacturing, and potentially printing made of more sustainable raw materials.</p>
<p>Delivery logistics will be a final and decisive link in an evolving <a title="3D print and manufacturing supply chain" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printing-and-manufacturing-supply-chain/">3D print and manufacturing supply chain</a>.</p>
