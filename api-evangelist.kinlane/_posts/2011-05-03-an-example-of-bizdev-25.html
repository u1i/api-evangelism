In 2006, Flickr co-founder Caterina Fake coined the phrase <a title="Biz Dev 2.0" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/07/biz-dev-2-0/">Biz Dev 2.0</a> in a blog post explaining how several small companies had approached Flickr wanting to provide services that the photo-sharing site didn't feature.<p></p>
She noted that Flickr executives had little time in their schedules to arrange meetings to hash out these partnerships, and instead encouraged companies to feel free to apply for a Commercial API key and build something off the API.<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/flickr.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /><p></p>
<a title="Biz Dev 2.0" href="http://caterina.net/archive/000996.html">Biz Dev 2.0</a>, she called it.<p></p>
Fast forward to 2011, APIs are a common part of the technology and business landscape.<p></p>
Some API providers have evolved their API offerings into platforms, and introduced self-service application development environments.<p></p>
From the pubic side, these are seen as service or application marketplaces where users can find add-ons they can use as part of the core web application.<p></p>
Think <a title="Google Marketplace" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/google-apps-marketplace/">Google Marketplace</a>, <a title="Facebook App Directory" href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/directory.php">Facebook App Directory</a>, and <a title="Box.net OpenBox" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/box-net-openbox/">Box.net OpenBox</a>.<p></p>
From the developers point of view these offer environments where they can easily build applications that integrate with an existing platform and user base.<p></p>
From the business perspective this is <a title="Biz Dev 2.5" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/bizdev-2-5-with-apis-and-self-service-platforms/">Biz Dev 2.5</a>.  Let me give you an example.<p></p>
When I started as API Evangelist for <a title="Mimeo.com" href="http://www.mimeo.com">Mimeo.com</a> a project that was already in the works was commercial print integration with <a title="Scribd.com" href="http://www.scribd.com">Scribd.com</a>.   After serveral months of negotiations Mimeo was able to get a button within Scribd, Print to Mimeo.<p></p>
This happened before I was around, but right before I was hired Scribd updated their application to HTML5 and the Print to Mimeo disappeared.<p></p>
To get back on Scribd's development radar would take another round of outreach, discussion and integration into their development schedule.<p></p>
Next on my list of cloud storage provider integration after Scribd, was Box.net.<p></p>
Box.net has an API and a self-service application development environment called <a title="OpenBox" href="http://www.box.net/developers/actions">OpenBox</a>.  I can add my application and integrate it into Box.net without coordinating with Box.net staff.<p></p>
Once ready I can submit for approval in the OpenBox directory, or keep private and just send invites out to users with a link directly to my OpenBox application.<p></p>
I have someone I can email at Box.net and discuss business development opportunities, but I don't have to.  I can do all the work myself.<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Box.net/box-net-250x161.jpg" alt="" align="right" /><p></p>
I'm able to build an application that uses the APIs of a leading web application provider, launch that application integrated into the platform, and access the existing user-base.   When users choose to use my application it adds actions or navigation options for them that are linked to my service.<p></p>
<a title="APIs" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/api-listing.php">APIs</a> + <a title="self-service application development environments" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/anatomy-of-a-self-service-application-platforms/">self-service application development environments</a> allow for entirely new business opportunities without the overhead of traditional business development, and with deeper integration into partner platforms.
