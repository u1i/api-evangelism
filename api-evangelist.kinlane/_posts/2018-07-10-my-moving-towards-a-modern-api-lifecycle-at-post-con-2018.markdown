I gave a talk early in in June at POST/CON 2018 in San Francisco. The conference was a great mix of discussions reflecting the Postman community. [You can find all the talks on Google](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM-7VG-sgbtCv6yx5Af3pGikTYIE3CAdu), including mine about moving towards a modern AP lifecycle.

You can find [all the stop along what I consider to be a modern API lifecycle on the home page of API Evangelist](http://apievangelist.com/), with links to any of my research, services, tooling, and other storytelling I've done in each area.

Thanks again to Postman for having me out!
