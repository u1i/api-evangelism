<p>I was trying to explain the experience of being at the <a href="http://defragcon.com/">Defrag Conference</a>, to a friend&nbsp;the other day.  We are both gearing up for the event, next week (November 14th &amp; 15th), in Broomfield Colorado, and he had never been to one so I wanted to share a little about what the experience is like.</p>
<p>The Defrag event is organized by Eric Norlin, who also organizes Gluecon and Blur conferences, all at the Omni Interlocken resort in Broomfield.  Each of Eric&rsquo;s events have evolved each year, but currently reflect the following focus:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://gluecon.com/2012/">Gluecon</a></strong> - Cloud, Mobile, APIs, Big Data for developers</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://defragcon.com/">Defrag</a></strong> - What's coming next  in technology</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.blurcon.com/">Blur</a></strong> - Human Computer Interaction (HCI)</li>
</ul>
<p>Eric has a unique way of bringing together the leaders from the space to discuss relevant technologies in a very intimate space.  The Omni Interlocken resort is a very key element to the events, which makes it unlike other events I attend.</p>
<p>The first of Eric&rsquo;s events I attended was a Gluecon, several years back.  We drove out to the location, and I remember thinking, &ldquo;oh man we are going to be stuck way out here for 4 days&rdquo;.  But as I learned, that is the point.</p>

<p>You are stuck in a very intimate location where you will eat killer grub, including beef sliders and drink some kick-ass craft beers while rubbing elbows and having deep technical and philosophical conversations with the deepest thinkers and leaders in our space.</p>
<p>Defrag and Glue are part of a small group of events I recommend you <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">never</span></strong> miss in the space.  I&rsquo;m pretty burnt out on large technology conferences, but the value you walk away with from Defrag can&rsquo;t be found anywhere else--putting Defrag in entireley different category for me.</p>
<p>I hope to see you at Defrag next week. If your there, I&rsquo;ll buy you an IPA, while we talk APIs.</p>
