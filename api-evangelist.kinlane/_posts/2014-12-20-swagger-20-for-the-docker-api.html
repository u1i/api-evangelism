<p>I&rsquo;m developing a common API for all the APIs I deploy via Docker containers, meaning that each API that I design as a Docker image, will have an API to control all aspects of deployment, and its operations. I will be keeping most of the surface area available in <a href="https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/docker_remote_api/#v116">current version of the Docker API</a>, but I'm thinking I will add a handful of endpoints, and maybe alter a couple of the existing Docker defined endpoints to better meet my needs.</p>
<p>To support my work, I need a Swagger 2.0 definition for the v1.16 of the Docker API. I wish everyone would create machine readable API definitions for their APIs by default, but until that is the norm, I will be creating myself. I&rsquo;m getting pretty good at writing scrape scripts for harvesting API documentation (if they are well formed).</p>
<p>This Swagger definition not 100% complete, but <a href="http://theapistack.com/data/docker/docker-remote-api-swagger.json">here is what I have so far of a Swagger 2.0 representation of the Docker v1.16 API</a>. Its on Github, so if you use this definition, and fix anything, or add parts and pieces i didn't, please submit back, so everyone can benefit from it. I haven't completed the data model for the endpoints, but I'm storing the JSON responses for each endpoint, and just need to set aside some time to finish.</p>
<p>You can find the <a href="http://theapistack.com/data/docker/docker-remote-api-swagger.json">Swagger 2.0 definition for the Docker v1.16 API on The API Stac</a>k, where <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">I publish all my Swagger definitions for the APIs</a> I integrate with, and monitor as part of my research. I&rsquo;m adding definitions all the time, so check back often, and if you have any API definitions I do not, feel free to fork the repo, and submit them via pull request. I&rsquo;m not just looking for Swagger, I'd love to have any format you generate machine readable API definitions in&mdash;it is important that all of this layer of the API space, is accessible, and machine readable, so please help make it so.</p>
