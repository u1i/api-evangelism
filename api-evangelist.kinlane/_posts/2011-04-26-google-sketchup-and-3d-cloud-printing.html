<p>I'm doing a lot of researching and thinking about the future of commercial printing, 3D printing, and manufacturing.</p>
<p>Yesterday I was brainstorming on <a title="3D printing and manufacturing with Google" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/04/3d-printing-and-manufacturing-with-google/">3D printing and manufacturing with Google</a>.<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google-sketchup/Google-SketchUp.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>Tonight I'm learning more about <a title="Google SketchUp" href="http://sketchup.google.com/intl/en/">Google SketchUp</a>,which <a title="Google added to Google Apps" href="http://googlesmb.blogspot.com/2010/12/now-available-with-google-apps-google_03.html">Google added toGoogle Apps</a> in December of 2010.</p>
<p>Google SketchUp allows anyone to build 3D models to the <a title="STL file format" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)">STL file format</a>, a standard for the 3D print industry.</p>
<p>3D printers like <a title="Shapeways" href="http://www.shapeways.com/">Shapeways</a> lets you upload your STL files, print and order them in their physical form..</p>
<p>Google SketchUp provides a free and professional version of the modeling software.</p>
<p>They also provide a <a title="3D Warehouse" href="http://sketchup.google.com/intl/en/product/3dwh.html">3D Warehouse</a> where you can find a collection of 3D models that are free to use.</p>
<p>There is a <a title="community of resources" href="http://sketchup.google.com/intl/en/community/">community of resources</a> as well as <a title="training" href="http://sketchup.google.com/intl/en/training/">training</a> and <a title="education" href="http://sketchup.google.com/intl/en/industries/education.html">education</a> materials to learn about the platform.</p>
<p>Everything is there to build models to be used in 3D printing and manufacturing.  The only missing link right now is integration with Google Cloud Print.<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/3D-Printing/shapeways_logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>Maybe Google will support STL file printing in the <a title="Google Cloud Print Services Interface" href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/google/google-cloud-print-services-interface/">Google Cloud Print  (GCP) Services Interface</a> soon.</p>
<p>3D printers like Shapeways could register their 3-D printers with GCP like I'm doing with <a title="Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API" href="http://developer.mimeo.com">Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API</a> for commercial printing.</p>
<p>Lots of possibilities for 3D printing and manufacturing with Google Sketchup, Google Cloud Print, and 3D printers like Shapeways.</p>
