<p>I talk about this concept often, but couldn't find any definitive post on APIs opening up a company, organization, or agency to outside ideas. This is something I hear from startups, up to federal government agencies, and from well known business brands, such as Absolut Vodka.</p>
<p>Absolut was one of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXk1dvLKl-U">keynotes at API Strategy &amp; Practice in Amsterdam</a>, this last march. Eva Sjokvist, from Absolut, walked us through the development of their <a href="https://addb.absolutdrinks.com/docs/">Absolut Drinks Database API</a>.&nbsp;An amazing story by itself, but one thing she said that stood out to me, which is an interestingly common by-product of the API lifecycle, was the process itself opened up the company, making it more receptive to outside ideas, and collaboration.</p>
<p>I hear this sentiment often from groups who are developing API programs at their companies, and you see shining examples, like <a href="http://developer.edmunds.com/">from Edmunds.com</a> with their <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/27/internal-api-summit-within-every-company/">internal API Summit</a>, but rarely do I see a metric to measure API driven, cultural change. APIs don't just open up your company&rsquo;s assets and resources for access by trusted partners, or potentially the public, establishing a sort of external R&amp;D lab, it has the potential to open up a valuable feedback loop as well, bringing in new ideas that have the potential to change how a group sees the world--evolving internal culture.</p>
<p>The potential for opening up a company, bringing them closer to their partners and customers, or a government agency, opening up healthier dialogue with constituents, is the most important results of an API program&mdash;greater than any single application that will get built on an API.</p>
