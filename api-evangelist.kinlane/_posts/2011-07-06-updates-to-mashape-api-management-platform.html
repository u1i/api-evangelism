<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/mashape/mashape-manage-your-APIs.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />Mashape<a title="released a few new enhancements" href="http://blog.mashape.com/introducing-some-new-things-inbox-new-wizard">released a few enhancements</a> to their API management platform.
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Inbox</strong> - Mashape redesigned their inbox and messaging system. Developers can contact you from your API detail page, and the inbox provides interface for managing developers and your conversations.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>API Wizard</strong> - The API setup and management wizard is no longer a step by step wizard. It now gives you five options in a left hand navigation, leaving the room for more options to be added in the future.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Private APIs</strong> - You can now deploy a private API with Mashape, only inviting the developers you want to have access.
     </li>
</ul>Some small changes, but prettyimportantchanges for API owners and developers who use <a title="Mashape" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/04/mashape-api-service-provider/">Mashape</a>.
<p></p>I would say the ability to deploy a private API is the most significant, as more people realize the value of APIs, and deploy them for partners, not the general public.
