<p>I got a gentle ping today, as I often do when there is a new developer hub or API launched in the federal government. This time it was located within the Department of Commerce, for the International Trade Administration, and was a new developer area, with five APIs at <a href="http://developer.trade.gov/">Developer.Trade.Gov</a>.</p>
<p>I quickly went through the new developer area, which I consider passing the test for a minimum viable developer area, possessing all the essential building blocks an API developer hub needs. The only places I feel it fell short is in the feedback loop, and providing machine readable definitions for each of the five APIs.</p>
<p>I submitted my feedback as Github issues, on the repository for the developer hub, but when it comes to machine readable definitions for each of the five APIs, I know how easy this is, so rather than just submit issues, I figured I'd get to work generating the machine readable API definitions for Developer.Trade.Gov, and demonstrate what was possible. As I do with all of my work, I setup a <a href="http://developer.trade.gov.apievangelist.com/">subdomain, and Github repository</a>, to store all of my work, and got to work on each of the five APIs:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://developer.trade.gov/market-research-library.html">Market Research Library</a> (<a href="http://developer.trade.gov.apievangelist.com/definitions/market-research-library.json">Swagger</a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://developer.trade.gov/ita-office-locations.html">ITA Offices &amp; Centers</a> (<a href="http://developer.trade.gov.apievangelist.com/definitions/ita-offices-and-centers.json">Swagger</a>)</li>
<li>Trade Events</li>
<li>Trade Leads</li>
<li>Trade News &amp; Articles</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/1w9oKpq"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-swagger-round.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I chose to use <a href="http://bit.ly/1w9oKpq">Swagger</a> for creating my machine readable API definitions, and while I was waiting for the Github commit to take for the Market Research Library API Swagger definition + Swagger UI, I got to work on the ITA Offices &amp; Centers API. As I was finishing up, I reloaded the <a href="http://developer.trade.gov.apievangelist.com/market-research-library-api.html">interactive docs for the Market Research Library API</a>, and got the dreaded CORS warning:</p>
<blockquote><em>Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at http://api.trade.gov/market_research_library/search?keyword=travel. This can be fixed by moving the resource to the same domain or enabling CORS.</em></blockquote>
<p>That is where the fun ends for me. I can keep creating Swagger specs for the other three APIs, but I won&rsquo;t be able to play with them until I create a proxy to make calls through, and open up CORS on my end. I will make time to do this over the weekend, but until then the fun stops. I am hoping they will also open up CORS, but I'm sure it will take a while.</p>
<p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/apis-json/apisdotjson.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>To wrap up my work, I also generated an <a href="http://developer.trade.gov.apievangelist.com/apis.json">APIs.json file for the Developer.Trade.Gov domain</a>, listing the details for both the Market Research Library API, and the ITA Offices &amp; Centers API--opening up the APIs to discovery by API search engines like APIs.io. When Developer.Trade.Gov publishes the APIs.json + Swagger specs under their domain, it will become more authoratative and given prominence in search engine results.</p>
<p>In about 2 hours, I was able to review a new developer area, and five APIs, generate two swagger specs, 1 APIs.json, publish to a Github repository where I launched interactive documentation for each of the two APIs, and wrap up with this story of my work. As with all of my work, you can find all of this <a href="https://github.com/commerce-data/developer.trade.gov">work at the Github repository,</a> and the best part is, when I pick the work back up, it is all in one location, <a href="http://developer.trade.gov.apievangelist.com/blog/">with complete notes about what I did</a>&mdash;helping me understand where I left off, in addition to allowing anyone else to step in and learn from the process.</p>
