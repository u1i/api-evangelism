<p><a href="/trends/baas.php">Backend as a Service</a> (BaaS) provider <a href="/serviceproviders/quickblox.php" target="_blank">QuickBlox</a> announced new <a href="http://quickblox.com/plans/">pricing plans</a>, which includes a free tier up to 10GB in traffic and storage, with unlimited API calls and push notifications.</p>
<p>The BaaS space is heating up with lots of discussion about whether you should charge developers by active user, features, storage or API call--with each provider being pretty vocal about where they stand.  Quickblox is approach similar to <a title="Stackmob" href="/serviceproviders/stackmob.php">StackMob</a>, who refuses to charge based upon API call, atributing it to a sucess tax. But Quickblox is somewhat different, as they still charge for hard costs like bandwidth and storage--Stackmob only charges by feature.</p>

I don't think there is a one size fits all strategy here, but I predict the conversation around BaaS pricing will continue to heat up in 2013 as the market continues to define itself.</p>
