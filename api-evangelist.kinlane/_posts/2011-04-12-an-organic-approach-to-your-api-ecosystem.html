<img src="http://www.luna-park.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/buddies.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />There are many  approaches to building an API ecosystem.  Some approach it more like building an API community, and others as growing an API ecosystem.<p></p>
<a title="Howard Liptzin" href="http://twitter.com/howardliptzin#">Howard Liptzin</a>, at Avatar Industries prefers a more <a title="organic approach to growing an API community" href="http://www.luna-park.com/blog/2011/02/28/developer-communities/">organic approach growing an API community</a>.  In his own words:
<blockquote><em>What you'll want to do is to create the conditions for a community to form, thrive, produce and grow.</em></blockquote>
Liptzin emphasises gardening over engineering, not managing your community, more facilitate. Before you even start, Liptzin offers a little advice:
<blockquote><em>Make sure your API actually solves a problem that merits solving!</em></blockquote>
Then Liptzin identifies five areas to address when growing your API ecosystem:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Creation</li>
	<li>Activation</li>
	<li>Retention</li>
	<li>Productivity</li>
	<li>Growth</li>
</ul>
It is great to see other API owners and evangelists share their philosophies and approach to growing their community.<p></p>
