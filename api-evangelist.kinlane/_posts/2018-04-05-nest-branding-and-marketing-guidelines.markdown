<p><img src="{{ page.image }}" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>I'm always looking out for examples of API providers who have invested energy into formalizing process around the business and politics of API operations. I'm hoping to aggregate a variety of approaches that I can aggregate into a single blueprint that I can use in my API storytelling and consulting. The more I can help API providers standardize what they do, the better off the API sector will be, so I'm always investing in the work that API providers should be doing, but doesn't always get prioritized.

The other day [while profiling the way that Nest uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) to stream activity via thermostats, cameras, and the other devices they provide](https://streamdata.io/blog/streaming-nest-api/), and [I stumbled across their branding policies](https://developers.nest.com/documentation/cloud/marketing-guide). It provides a pretty nice set of guidance for Nest developers in respect to the platform's brand, and something you don't see with many other API providers. I always say that branding is the biggest concern for new API providers, but also the one that is almost never addressed by API providers who are in operation--which doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me. If I had a major corporate brand, I'd work to protect it, and help developers understand what is important.

The Nest marketing program is intended to qualify applications, and then allow them to use the "Works with Nest" branding in your marketing and social media. To get approved you have submit your product or service for review. As part of the review process verifies that you are in compliance with all of their branding policies, including:

- [User interface guide](https://developers.nest.com/documentation/cloud/ui-guide)
- [User experience guide](https://developers.nest.com/documentation/cloud/ux-guide)
- [Trademark policy](https://developers.nest.com/documentation/cloud/brandguide-tm)

To apply for the program you have to email them with all the following details regarding the marketing efforts our your product or service where you will be using the "Works with Nest" branding:

- Description of your marketing program
- Description of your intended audience
- Planned communication (list all that apply): Print, Radio, TV, Digital Advertising, OOH, Event, Email, Website, Blog Post, Email, Social Post, Online Video, PR, Sales, Packaging, Spec Sheet, Direct Mail, App Store Submission, or other (please specify)
- High resolution assets for the planned communication (please provide URL for file download); images should be at least 1000px wide
- Planned geography (list all that apply): Global, US, Canada, UK, or other (please specify)
- Estimated reach: 1k - 50k, 50k- 100k, 100k - 500k, or 500k+
- Contact Information: First name, last name, email, company, product name, and phone number

Once submitted, Nest says they'll provide feedback or approval of your request within 5 business days, and if all is well, they'll approve your marketing plan for that Works with Nest product. If they find any submission is not in compliance with their branding policies, they'll ask you to make corrections to your marketing, so you can submit again. I don't have too many examples of marketing and branding submission process as part of [my API branding research](http://branding.apievangelist.com/). I have the user interface guide, and trademark policy as building blocks, but the user experience guide, and the details of the submission process are all new entries to my research.

I feel like API providers should be able to defend the use of their brand. I do not feel API providers can penalize and cut-off API consumers access unless there are clear guidelines and expectations presented regarding what is healthy, and unhealthy behavior. If you are concerned about how your API consumers reflect your brand, then take the time to put together a program like Nest has. You can look at [my wider API branding research](http://branding.apievangelist.com/) if you need other examples, or I'm happy to dive into the subject more as part of a consulting arrangement, and help craft an API branding strategy for you. Just let me know.

_**Disclosure:** I do not "Work with Nest" -- I am just showcasing the process. ;-)_
