<p>The end of last year I was asked to spent time thinking about three things: 1) <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/fafsa-api/">An API for the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA</a>)  2) Next steps for the Green Button API 3) <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/06/what-is-next-for-the-us-government-api-strategy/">API strategy for the overall United States Government</a>. I managed to find the bandwidth to get two of the three projects active, but neglected to spend time on the Green Button API.</p>
<p>To support my research I established a <a href="http://doe-data.github.io/green-button-api/">Green Button API repository on Github</a>, where  will track all my work. My goal is to pull together all the existing pieces of the Green Button API into one place, and evolve a strategy for taking Green Button API the next step. Like I did with the FAFSA API, I just want to explore what is possible, and jump start a conversation either within government and outside with other 3rd parties.</p>
<p>I've spent a few hours gathering what elements I could find about Green Button&mdash;existing sites, APIs, code, documentation, etc. Over the next couple of weeks I will spend more time connecting the dots, and tell the story via my Green Button API project blog.</p>
<p>If you have any resources I should consider, or would like to provide any feedback, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/doe-data/green-button-api/issues">Github issue management for the Green Button API repository</a>.</p>
