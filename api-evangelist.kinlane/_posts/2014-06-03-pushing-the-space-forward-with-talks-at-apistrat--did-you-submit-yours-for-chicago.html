<p>I&rsquo;m working my way through the collection of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/apistrat">talks from API Strategy &amp; Practice Amsterdam that are available on Youtube</a>, and I'm reminded of what an amazing lineup of speakers we've managed to assemble at not just #APIStrat Amsterdam, but also in San Francisco and New York.</p>
<p>Today I re-watched three videos which I think reflect not just #APIStrat, but also where we are at in the industry:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOjESChb0sU">Mike Amundsen</a> </strong>- In an effort to understand where we are going with the API economy , Mike looks back at the history of computing, trying to understand how we got here, uncovering some interesting patterns, while weaving it all together into a compelling story worthy of a Ken Burns PBS documentary.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkKEZMjFLSQ">Romain Huet</a></strong> - When selecting talks for #APIStrat we don't just select big brands, we look for the most compelling speakers, and the #APIStrat audience got both with a walk through the Twittersphere and bonus look at the convergence of Internet of Things and APIs, by taking an audience selfie, and flying a drone on stage, from Romain Huett of Twitter.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXk1dvLKl-U">Eva Sjokvist</a></strong> - Eva from Absolut Vodka wowed the #APIStrat audience with the story of their cocktail database API, which went beyond tech, and internally changed culture at the leading vodka manufacturer, teaching them how to look outside the company walls and realize the benefits of external partnerships.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m still working my way through other talks, but these three stand out as examples of what we look for from presenters at #APIStrat. Our speakers tell stories, wow the audience with entertaining demonstrations of the power of APIs, while showcasing how APIs have made an impact at companies, and within industries around the globe.</p>
