<p>I was just downloading all of my Facebook data.  You can <a href="https://www.facebook.com/download">go under your account settings and there is a little link</a> that lets you download everything. &nbsp;It takes some time to generate a full archive, but once my archive is ready, they&rsquo;ll email me and I can get at my data and see what the download format looks like.</p>
<p>While waiting, I wanted to see what Google had to offer.  Google has an amazing <a href="https://www.google.com/dashboard">acount management dashboard</a> which provides you access to your settings, some of the data, but Google is also working on their <a title="takeout service" href="https://www.google.com/takeout/">takeout service</a> which gives you downloads for individual services and across multiple services.</p>
<p>That is a pretty good start.  Two of my biggest networks allow me to download data. I wasn't so lucky with the next four:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Twitter - No</li>
<li>Instagram - No</li>
<li>Foursquare - No</li>
<li>LinkedIn - Some (just your connections)</li>
</ul>
<p>I use all six of these services daily.  It bums me out that I can&rsquo;t get out my own data.  Of course all of these services have an API, which allows developers to get at my data, but even <a title="Twitter&rsquo;s API doesn&rsquo;t give me full access to all my accounts data" href="http://apivoice.com/2012/06/29/twitter-continues-to-restrict-access-to-our-tweets/">Twitter&rsquo;s API doesn&rsquo;t give me full access to all my accounts data</a>.</p>

<p>I want access to a data store of all my <a title="Facebook" href="https://www.singly.com/docs/facebook">Facebook</a>, <a title="Google" href="https://www.singly.com/docs/gcontacts">Google</a>, <a title="Twitter" href="https://www.singly.com/docs/twitter">Twitter</a>, <a title="Instagram" href="https://www.singly.com/docs/instagram">Instagram</a>, <a title="Foursquare" href="https://www.singly.com/docs/foursquare">Foursquare</a> and <a title="LinkedIn" href="https://www.singly.com/docs/linkedin">LinkedIn</a> data in a single location.  There are software available trying to solve this problem such as <a title="ThinkUp" href="http://thinkupapp.com/">ThinkUp</a> or <a title="The Locker Project" href="http://lockerproject.org/">The Locker Project</a>.  As with APIs, these solutions require you to be a developer. (I see ThinkUp has a cloud solution now)</p>
<p>At this point I&rsquo;m thinking about how to build an application using <a title="Singly" href="https://singly.com">Singly</a>, one that allows me to pull posts, tweets, photos, friends and other vital personal data into a single store. &nbsp;I need to think it through.</p>
<p>Then I really start questioning the storage of all of my social data.  Do I really even want it all in one location?  Do I just want it in another location, a sort of plan B.  It really depends on the data.  I guess I have to think about each service and how I want the data replicated, moved, syndicated or otherwise. This is beginning to sound a lot like <a title="API Automation" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/08/21/api-automation-platforms/">API automation</a> to me and not just data liberation.</p>
<p>I hate ending a post, without wrapping up an idea properly. &nbsp;I'll just have to work out in another post, but then again that is why this is on my personal blog and not API Evangelist or API Voice.</p>
