<p>I sent three emails this morning to people, explaining what it is that I do and how they can get involved. This process reminded me that I need to do the same here via the blog on a regular basis, to help people understand what API Evangelist is, and my vision for it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite popular belief I do not evangelize any single API to developers, my role (self-appointed) is to evangelize <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span> APIs to the masses, most importantly beyond the developer community--penetrating business, marketing and other key groups.</p>
<p>At API Evangelist I monitor the entire API space. To do this I track on 2000 of the best of the APIs out there.&nbsp;&nbsp;I've gone through the entire <a href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb Directory</a> and hand pick the ones that are worth paying attention to, and I continue doing this in real-time as they are added. Its not that the rest aren't worthy of use, just not an approach I feel is worth showcasing to other API owners.</p>
<p>700+ of these APIs have blogs, 1000+ have Twitter accounts and many have Github accounts. I monitor all in real time. I also track on 250+ blog feeds from mainstream tech blogs (TC, Gigaom, etc) as well as lesser known feeds. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I watch all this in real-time and tag everything using a centralized system I've developed.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where I derive my blog posts and generate what I call my&nbsp;<a href="http://theapistack.com/"><span class="s1">API Stack</span></a>. The API Stack isn't meant to be a definitive list of who are the best, in a single order, but a living stack of which APIs are worth paying attention to, and are doing innovative things on a week to week basis.</p>
<p>I generate The API Stack using my home grown ranking system which is based upon 3 types of signals:&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Internal&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;- Number of blog posts, tweets, github repos and other internal activity from the APIs themselves</li>
<li><strong>External -</strong>&nbsp;@mentions of twitter, stack exchange, hacker news, tech blogosopher, github repo follwers and activity</li>
<li><strong>Analsyst -</strong>&nbsp;My curation, flagging w/ notes, voting up and writing stories about an API or company</li>
</ul>
<p>From all of this weekly process I have carved several areas I focus deeper on:</p>

<p>These areas will evolve and grow as my research continues and the space changes.&nbsp;&nbsp;From all of this research I produce short form analysis (blog posts, project sites) and long form content (whitepapers, books).&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep things simple I provide a single standard monthly subscription to partners wishing to access of all this for $1500.00 / month.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li class="li4"><strong>Writing&nbsp;</strong>- Access to all of my long form content.&nbsp;&nbsp;White papers, research, etc.</li>
<li class="li4"><strong>Data</strong>&nbsp;- I generate a lot of data exhaust tracking, ranking and curating the API space.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have JSON data available across all aspects of my work.</li>
<li class="li4"><strong>Logo</strong>&nbsp;- Placement of maximum 250px width logo on right hand menu of API Evangelist properties.</li>
<li class="li4"><strong>4 Consulting Hours</strong>&nbsp;- Four hours of conversation via phone, skype or hangout each month.</li>
<li class="li4"><strong>Keywords</strong>&nbsp;- Your company name plus one other keyword or key phrase of choice which will link to URL of your choice.</li>
<li class="li4"><strong>Weekly / Monthly Summary -</strong>&nbsp;I produce a weekly and monthly summary of the top APIs and industries, with curated news and my analysis from the API industry.</li>
</ul>
<p>This monthly subscription provides access to all research, data and writing I produce.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm willing to negotiate other relationships, but this helps me keep a nice pool of clients, and me knowing I'll be in operation next month.&nbsp;&nbsp;Keeps me focused on research and not chasing new customers all the time.</p>
<p>Sometimes I also do specific industry research looking for patterns and opportunities as well going deeper by targeting specific APIs, like Twitter or Twillio, but I try to keep targeted research feeding into my overall pool of industry data, providing value to the bigger picture and overall space.</p>
<p>Hope this helps you understand what it is I do, and if you'd like to get involved, feel free to reach out.</p>
