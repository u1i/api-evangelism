<p>Have you taken a moment and looked at the APIs AT&amp;T is offering through their <a href="http://developer.att.com/">developer program</a> lately? I think it is an interesting spread of API resources for a leading telco to offer, and is very telling about their strategy.</p>
<p>This is one thing I like about my API monitoring platform, is that I'm forced to dive deeper into companies that are ubiquitous in the space, and make sure I'm kep in tune with where they are actually going.</p>
<p>I thought <a href="https://developer.att.com/developer/basicTemplate.jsp?passedItemId=12500043">AT&amp;T's API catalog</a> was interesting in its current state:</p>

<p>Some of the APIs they offer are pretty straightforward like MMS, SMS, Location and Speech. &nbsp;But the TV, Healthcare, Notary and even advertising seem like they are from a different planet. Which is a signal in itself I think.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T pops up on my radar a lot because of their presence at hackathons, and coverage in the blogosphere. &nbsp;I'd like to make more time to dissect AT&amp;T's approach to APIs from an outside perspective. I think there is a lot to learn from their strategy, both good and bad. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Stay tuned...</p>
