<p>I spoke with Phil Windley (<a href="https://twitter.com/windley">@windley</a>) over at <a href="http://byu.edu">Brigham Young University (BYU)</a> about their API strategy this morning. BYU is bringing together API providers and consumers, to establish a coordinated strategy for delivering designing, deploying, managing, and integrating with APIs across campus--an effort being led by <a href="http://cio.byu.edu/">CIO Kelly Flannagan</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/kelflanagan">@kelflanagan</a>).</p>
<p>As part of their latest API effort, BYU is focusing in on the lowest hanging fruit when it comes to campus resources:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Students</li>
<li>Instructors</li>
<li>Classrooms</li>
<li>Classes</li>
<li>Courses</li>
</ul>
<p>The API team is still struggling with a handful of technical details like how to deal with unique identifiers, and relationship between resources, but overall they are on a healthy path when it comes to getting their API designed, and deployed for use at the institution. I&rsquo;m interested in seeing how fast they progress with a top down approach to APIs, vs the bottom up efforts I&rsquo;m seeing at institutions like <a href="https://developer.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a>.</p>
<p>I will be talking their team regularly, about their design, deployment, management, and integration strategy. I want to make sure and document the process all along the way, and share real-time updates that other universities can follow along, or possibly collaborate with us when it comes to establishing some common API patterns we can share and re-use across higher educational institutions.</p>
<p>Look for any stories out of BYU, here on API Evangelist, or over at my <a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/">university API research site</a>, and if you are doing any API work at your school, I'd love to know more about it.</p>
