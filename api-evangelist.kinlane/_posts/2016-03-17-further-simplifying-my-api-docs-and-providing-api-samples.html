<p>For some workshops preparation this week, I needed to isolate just the best of the API calls and documentation from handful of APIs I am trying to teach my intended audience about. <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/university-api-workshop/apis/">I have almost twenty separate companies targeted</a>, with a couple hundred individual endpoints across the API provided served up by these companies. I needed to a way to easily define, organize, and present a subset of API samples, intended for a specific purpose audience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this workshop, I need the simplest, most intuitive samples possible across these popular APIs. For Twitter I need to be able to just send a tweet, or list friends, and on Facebook I need to post to my wall, and search for user. I need simple actions, that will be meaningful to my higher education audience--most likely students. I don't want to bury all of them with the endless API possibilities that surround the APIs I'm showcasing, I need the twenty use cases that they'll give a shit about, and result in them being interested in what an API is.</p>
<p>As I do with all my research, I organize my lists of APIs into APIs.json collections, and publish the results as a Github repository. This allows me to quickly assemble, relevant collections of APIs, designed for specific audiences, in a way that I can wrap with informative content and stories, helping them on-board with the importance of APIs, as well as the individual APIs. This got me thinking, because as part of an APIs.json index I have all the moving parts identified, I just need a way to simplify, and distill down into little API samples, so that I can offer up through the experience I am crafting.</p>
<p>To help me in my effort I started defining a new APIs.json API type schema, which allows me to define a sample subset of any API I have defined using OpenAPI Spec. Within each schema, I can map to a specific endpoint + method present in the OpenAPI Spec, select which parameters will be used, and what the default values and enum will be applied. I also provide a title, description, and now I have a machine readable schema for my API sample. Next, I just need to craft a simple API Samples JS library for rendering these samples into widgets and other embeddable goodies.</p>
<p>Each sample will use the security definition defined within the OpenAPI Spec to get the authentication details it needs, render it as a simple widget, which allows users to quickly make a relevant API request, and see the results immediately. This really is no different than API explorers and interactive docs like Swagger UI, but rather than providing a complete UI or docs, it provides just a sample, to help educate the API consumer around what is an API, as well as what any single API does.</p>
<p>While I think samples can live alongside the regular API docs, and explorers, within the portal of each API, I'm thinking they will become exponentially more valuable when used in a <a href="http://hackerstorytelling.com/">hacker storytelling</a>, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/10/exploring-the-possibilities-of-being-an-api-broker/">API broker</a>, and evangelism setting. I have the base JSON schema defined for my API Samples, and once I get a working prototype for the JS client, I will publish a simple page, demonstrating a few use cases. At first I'll just be using to help people understand the value of APIs in general, as well as specific APIs, but I think future I will be able to get more sophisticated in how I tell stories around stacks of APIs, and how APIs can be assembled to accomplish bigger things than just any single API can accomplish on its own.</p>
<p>Hopefully in the near future, I will have a wealth of API Samples for the most important APIs I profile as part of my API Stack work, providing me with some valuable education and storytelling tooling to assist me in my evangelism work.&nbsp;</p>
