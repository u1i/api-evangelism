<p>API metrics are an essential, but what should we measure?  There are two metrics that seems to dominate discussions about success of the API industry:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Number of New API Registration</li>
<li>Number of Daily and Monthly API Calls</li>
</ul>
<p>Every API I&rsquo;ve consulted with, use the same two metrics, if they have any at all.  The tech blogosphere (driven by <a title="API service proviers" href="http://apievangelist.com/serviceproviders/">API service providers</a>) have created a so call <a title="billionaires club" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/05/25/who-belongs-to-the-api-billionaires-club/">billionaires club</a>, showcasing APIs that have over a billion API calls within a day or month.</p>
<p>Investors are even using the number of API calls as a<a title="considered a metric you can use to consider the valuation of a company by investors" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/03/kleiner-klout-30-million/">&nbsp;metric to consider the valuation of a company</a>, and seen as a good indicator of the demand for a company&rsquo;s services.</p>
<p>I agree that new registrations and number of API calls are a start, but we should be able to identify many other metrics to truly measure the activity and success of an API and the sentiment of it's API developer community.</p>
