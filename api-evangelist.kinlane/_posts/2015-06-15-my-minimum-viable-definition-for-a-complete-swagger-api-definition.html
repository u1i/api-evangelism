<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/06/how-do-you-know-when-a-swagger-api-definition-is-complete/">I have been working hard to establish some sort of minimum viable definition for a complete Swagger definition is</a>, and I think I finally have got to a point where I have it--at least enough to work through the next 100 or so APIs I'm targeting for completion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I originally identified almost 30 separate questions specifically targeting Swagger, but for my minimum viable definition I've isolated it to just 19. I automated asking of these questions, using <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/question/">my Questions API</a>, and to test things out I applied it to my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/api/">API API</a>:</p>
<table id="questionlist" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" width="100%">

<p>In theory, I can run this on any <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> file, and it will return answers for any API that has a valid Swagger file present. My goal is to provide me with a quick action todo list for <a href="http://theapistack.com/companies.html">any API in my API Stac</a>k.</p>
<p>Now I want some sort of way to certify that all these questions were asked, import the Swagger into Postman, or some other tool and actually execute a real call against each endpoint. I'm still evaluating how to record this information somewhere, so it can be verified at any time, but anyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyways, I have about 50 APis targeted for completion, using my new Questions API. <a href="http://api-questions.apievangelist.com/swagger.html">I even created a simple little widget to ask the questions of each API, something I will automate as soon as possible, and build into my API stack</a>.</p>
