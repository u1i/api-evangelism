<p>I&rsquo;m doing my usual monitoring of the API space, and while looking at various developer areas, I stumbled across the <a href="https://developer.target.com/">Target Developer Portal</a>. I find the Target developer portal interesting because it is publicly available, but before you can get any information you have to register or login.</p>
<p>When you land on the landing page for developer.target.com you simple get a page that says:</p>
<blockquote><em>Please Note: Access to the developer portal is restricted to Target employees and trusted third parties that currently have a working relationship with Target Corporation. Registration requests that do not meet these guidelines will be rejected.</em></blockquote>
<p>I would like to see more information about Target&rsquo;s API efforts, which I think they could do without giving away business intelligence, but overall I support the line they are walking with their API efforts. To me, Target is making a statement that they have an API, and if you are <em>"Target employees and trusted third parties"</em>, you can get more access--it is a start, so I'm hopeful.</p>
<p>I'm part of many private API discussions lately, where I&rsquo;m trying to educate companies about the benefits of being more public, and I think we&rsquo;ll see more companies take targets approach to publishing their developer API portal in coming years.</p>
<p>My only hope is that more of them will also share a blog, and other details about what they are up to, and hopefully some day even some publicly available APIs providing access to information that is already available on their website.</p>
