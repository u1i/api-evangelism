<p>This summer its been 2 years since I started API Evangelist.  API Evangelist started as my research project into the Business of APIs, and became a full time career.</p>
<p>While over the last two years I&rsquo;ve worked for clients like <a title="Mimeo" href="http://developer.mimeo.com">Mimeo</a> and <a title="CityGrid" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com">CityGrid</a>, my ultimate goal is to focus on studying the Business of APIs.  So whenever I get the time, I study how popular APIs operate, and how they are transforming industries.</p>
<p>This month, I&rsquo;m getting the opportunity to dive deeper into my research around different API business models, with the chance to look at the politics within specific API ecosystems.</p>
<p>While my research will always span the entire API sector, this round I&rsquo;m going to study the approach of some of the most successful APIs:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Twitter</strong> - Deep understanding of the largest, and most important API ecosystem</li>
<li><strong>Facebook</strong> - Better understanding of the largest API driven social platform</li>
<li><strong>Google</strong> - Document the 100 or so APIs offered by Google, and the platform that connects them</li>
<li><strong>LinkedIn</strong> - Better picture of the leading business social network platform</li>
<li><strong>Amazon</strong> - Document the history of this API pioneer</li>
<li><strong>Twilio</strong> - Understand how Twilio continues to deliver their API, and woo developers</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to begin by&nbsp;<a title="analyzing the business and politics of Twitters API ecosystem" href="http://apivoice.com/2012/05/06/the-business-and-politics-of-twitters-api/">analyzing the business and politics of Twitters API ecosystem</a>, and as more funding comes through I&rsquo;ll focus on the other APis.  While studying each API I look at:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Historical company blog posts, tweets and press releases</li>
<li>Historical blog posts and tweets from the blogosphere and developers</li>
</ul>
<p>I organize all my research into a curation framework I&rsquo;ve developed and will be generating:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Timeline</strong> - A easy to navigate, timeline of the APIs history through curated blog posts, tweets and company announcments.</li>
<li><strong>Blog Posts</strong>&nbsp;- Single and series of blog posts documenting the business and politics of each API provider.</li>
<li><strong>Final Paper(s)</strong> - Each project will have at least one final white-paper with findings from the research.</li>
<li><strong>Raw Research</strong> - A searchable repository of curated research and notes from my work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then making this work available across both <a title="apievangelist.com" href="http://apievangelist.com">apievangelist.com</a> and my new blog <a title="apivoice.com" href="http://apivoice.com">apivoice.com</a>, which tends to focus on the politics of APIs including legal and other issues affecting developer ecosystems.</p>
<p>I feel pretty strongly that this new round of research will help me better understand the business and politics of APIs, produce rich research, stories and industry reports that I can make available--helping us all better understand this ever changing API economy.</p>
