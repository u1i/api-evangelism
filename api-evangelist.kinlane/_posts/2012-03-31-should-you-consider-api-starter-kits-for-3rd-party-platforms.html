<p>While assembling the building blocks for a successful API ecosystem, one of the requests I get from developers is for tools to help them build successful integrations with existing platforms like Wordpress, Drupal, Facebook and Salesforce.</p>
<p>Some of the requests I get are from non-developers who just want a plug and play tool, they can deploy without needing to write code--but many of the requests are for white label, starter kits that developers can use to quickly deploy API driven applications on popular platforms like:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="Wordpress" href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a></li>
<li><a title="Drupal" href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a></li>
<li><a title="Facebook" href="http://developers.facebook.com/">Facebook</a></li>
<li><a title="Salesforce" href="http://developer.force.com/">Salesforce</a></li>
<li><a title="Joomla" href="http://www.joomla.org/">Joomla</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an expert in any of these platforms, but I find the more I dive into developing on these platforms, the more I learn and the more I discover other experts who really understand the ins and outs of building plugins and add-ons for 3rd party systems. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to building code samples, code libraries and generic start kits for your API, you may want to take a look at building white label, 3rd party platform plugins and add-ons your developers can use to quickly integrate your API into existing networks. &nbsp;</p>
<p>At the very least, you will learn a lot.</p>
