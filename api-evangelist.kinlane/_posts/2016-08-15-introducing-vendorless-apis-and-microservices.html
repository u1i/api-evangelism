<p>I'm a big fan of the concept of <a href="http://serverless.apievangelist.com">serverless</a> APIs and <a href="http://microservices.apievangelist.com">microservices</a>, but not so much of the name. I get it, the space needs new concepts to rally around, and I'm the first to admit even the concept of an API is bullshit, but when people say serverless, it always makes me chuckle--especially when people work so hard to sell it (who am I to make fun of that).</p>
<p>Often when I come across a serverless solution, it is often bundled with the phrase "100% serverless", a description which usually then contains the 2-6 vendor solutions used to deploy said serverless solution. I know there is no use in pointing out there are always servers behind serverless solutions, but can I at least point out the vendor dependencies involved? Are the vendor dependencies better or worse than our dependencies on servers (that never went away)? IDK. WTF. BBQ.</p>
<p>In support&nbsp;of this&nbsp;line of thinking, I want to start promoting the concept of vendorless&nbsp;APIs and microservices. You know the ones that employ web, and open source technology? Then I can label my microservices as vendorless,&nbsp;made from the finest gluten free, organic HTTP, <a href="http://webconcepts.info/">free-range web concepts</a> available today!</p>
