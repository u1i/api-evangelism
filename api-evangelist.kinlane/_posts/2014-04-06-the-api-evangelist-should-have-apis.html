<p>As I have evolved my blog from a content management system into an API industry monitoring system, much like other companies I work with, I&rsquo;m making the switch to use more APIs in my operations. As I roll out these APIs, I want to share them with you, here within the API Evangelist developer area.</p>
<p>Here at developer.apievangelist.com you will find APIs that give you access to the content I curate and turn into stories, the analysis I provide on the API space, and companies, tools and other resources that I use make API Evangelist go around.</p>
<p>Sometimes I will roll out APIs as separate projects, and other times I will roll them out here, the central API area for API Evangelist.  I&rsquo;m working to separate out some of my resources, much like other companies do in the space, and allow my internal systems to read / write, while also providing public and partner access to these resources. I am even working to create premium, pay for use API resources, but most of the time you will find my APIs are free.</p>
<p>If there is anything you&rsquo;d like to see me publish, let me know. You can use the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/developer-api-evangelist/issues">issue management for the Github repository</a> that houses this project to share any comments, thoughts or issues. Thanks for tuning in!</p>
