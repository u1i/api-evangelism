<a href="http://www.superfeedr.com/" target="_blank">Superfeedr</a> is now supporting <a href=" http://disqus.com/forums/superfeedr-thoughts/superfeedr_pubsubhubbub_for_apis/trackback/" target="_blank">PubSubHubbub for data APIs</a>.  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/">PubSubHubbub</a> was initially created for <a class="zem_slink" title="XML" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">XML</a> to alleviate the number of times a feed is polled versus how many times it actually has an update.

<img style="paddng: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Superfeedr.png" alt="" align="right" /></a> The bandwidth consumption and server load of an API can be reduced greatly by adding a PubSubHubbub layer on a data API.<p></p>
Primary areas of a Superfeedr PubSubHubbub deployment are:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Resource Identification </strong>- Identify what services your developers / applications are polling the most.  Identify how many requests are made against how many times information was returned.</li>
	<li><strong>Push Discovery -</strong> Indication to any applications polling your API that the content being polled is available in a push fashion by adding an HTTP header to the API responses which mentions the Superfeedr hub.</li>
	<li><strong>Secure Subscriptions - </strong>Define a subscription callback URL where Superfeedr will echo all subscriptions to the API content, including the <a class="zem_slink" title="List of HTTP header fields" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields">HTTP headers</a> and any additional parameter provided by the subscriber.</li>
	<li><strong>Notifications -</strong> Superfeedr needs to know when content is updated so they can notify users.  This is done in two ways:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Fat pings -</strong> An API owner can push content to Superfeeder and they will parse the content and push it forward to subscribers.</li>
	<li><strong>Light pings -</strong> Provide URL that has been updated and Superfeedr will update poll and update users.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Superfeedr PubSubHubbub is providing a layer to existing data APIs that will alleviate bandwidth and server load.<p></p>
We are seeing similar layers being built for functional APIs such as the XMPP print jobs notification for the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/cloudprint/docs/proxyinterfaces.html" target="_blank">Google Cloud Print (GCP) Services Interface</a>.
