<p>When I come across a new company, during the course of my monitoring and information gathering across the API space, I enter them into my company API. Once a company is in there, and I&rsquo;ve deemed it worthy enough for a closer look, I profile their operations.</p>
<p>For my own organization, and in the spirit of transparency and collaboration, I wanted to breakdown what I mean by profiling. First I start with the basics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong> - The official name for any company or project. APis aren&rsquo;t always clearly defined corporate entities.</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong> - A short, concise description of what a company does. You&rsquo;d be surprised how hard this is.</li>
<li><strong>Logo</strong> - A clean, simple, medium resolution logo for company. Again, you&rsquo;d be surprised how hard this is.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I dive into the common URLs that I care about, that provide me with the best signals possible:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blog</strong> - The heartbeat of any company, and API operations. In my opinion, the blog is one of the most important aspects of operations.</li>
<li><strong>Blog RSS</strong> - A simple, machine readable blog stream &mdash; blown away by how many companies don&rsquo;t have.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter</strong> - An active, engaged Twitter account, providing me easy access via the Twitter API.</li>
<li><strong>Github</strong> - A complete, active Github user or organization, where I can access code, and other aspects of API operations via Github API.</li>
<li><strong>Crunchbase</strong> - A business profile of a company, with a focus on the investment, and runway for company, available via Crunchable API.</li>
<li><strong>Angelist</strong> - Similar to Crunchbase a business profile of a company, with a focus on the investment, and runway for company, available via Angelist API.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I tackle the API, or APIs, and profile each API they have by gathering:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong> - A clean, portable name that describes the API, but keeps context of company or organization running it.</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong> - A short, concise description of what an API does &mdash; this is another pain in the ass to find most of the time.</li>
<li><strong>BaseURL</strong> - The base url for API calls. The process of finding this, will often determine for me, whether or not an API is worth monitoring.</li>
<li><strong>Swagger</strong> - Doing the deep dive on an API, and generating a machine readable definition of at least the API surface area, and include underlying data model, and authentication when I can.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I sweep through the rest of the API program looking for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Management Building Blocks - </strong>Run through my list of <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">common API management building blocks</a>, and record if any are present.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication Building Blocks - </strong>Track what type of authentication is available for the API, including supporting building blocks.</li>
<li><strong>Monetization Definition -</strong> Profile how money is made around an API, even if their are indirect benefits when possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once done, I have everything I need to establish a robust profile of an API provider, and add them to my monitoring. To assist me in my profiling, I then generate an <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.son</a> for the company, providing a machine readable version of all the information I&rsquo;ve gathered in my profiling. This doesn&rsquo;t always happen all at once, the companies usually queue up, then I go through and do full profiles in controlled sprints.</p>
<p>As with all of my research, y<a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">ou can find the resulting APIs.son files on Github</a>, and as my monitoring continues, I will aggregate more companies doing interesting things with APIs, and as I have the time I will generate full profiles for each one.</p>
<p>If there is a specific company you&rsquo;d like profiled, please let me know.</p>
