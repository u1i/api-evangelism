<p>I&rsquo;m spending more time reaching out directly to API providers, in an effort to better understand what they are up to. A couple weeks ago, I asked Sarfaraz Rydhan (<a href="https://twitter.com/safoo">@safoo</a>)&nbsp;from the <a href="https://siftscience.com/">Fraud Detection API platform SiftScience</a>, what is the biggest challenge you face in attracting developers to your system?</p>
<blockquote><em>In many cases, the biggest challenge is developers needing context into the business and operations side of the companies they work for. We offer a machine learning powered fraud detection product to help internet companies in many verticals fight fraud. In an e-commerce integration, for example, a developer may need to know about how users interact with the store, when a customer's credit card is charged, how order information is sent to the warehouse for fulfillment, how operations analysts work within the e-commerce system.</em></blockquote>
<p>Context--something that is so important, and is often lost in translation, or forgotten entirely when APIs are purely an IT or developer led initiative. As a developer I can easily see the many uses of an API, but articulating to someone who is actually living within one of these use-case scenarios, is very difficult&mdash;something that takes a lot of practice.</p>
<p>You can see SiftScience working to provide context to its users via its <a href="https://siftscience.com/">website</a>, <a href="http://blog.siftscience.com/">blog</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/siftscience">twitter</a>, and other <a href="https://siftscience.com/resources/tutorials/integration.html">tutorials and resources</a>. As API providers, this is why we provide essential storytelling building blocks like a blog, tutorials, and other resources&mdash;to provide the critical context someone needs to understand the value that our APIs deliver.</p>
<p>Are you providing enugh context for your users?</p>
