<p>I have a lot of ideas while being the API Evangelist. It just comes with the territory. I have an Evernote folder that I publish these ideas to, and some of them, like my <a href="http://screen-capture.apievangelist.com/">Screen Capture API</a>, I actually make a reality.</p>
<p>The other night while writing, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/02/shadow-api-launching-an-api-before-someone-else-does/">Shadow API: Launching An API Before Someone Else Does</a>, I went to add the Nebraska homestead record API idea to my Evernote, and I said, ENOUGH! I need a public place to store these ideas, and while I'm at it, I'll enable others to publish ideas there too.</p>
<p>What better way to allow collaboration around a content store or dataset, than a Github repository plus API. So I launched <a href="http://ideas.apievangelist.com/">API Ideas</a>, as an individual API project, on the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/network.html">API Evangelist Network</a>. I allows me to retrieve, and add to a list of API ideas, all stored on Github, using a simple web API.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be evolving the API over time, you can <a href="http://ideas.apievangelist.com/roadmap.html">engage with me on the roadmap</a>, and see <a href="http://ideas.apievangelist.com/blog/">stories around the project on the updates page</a>. It is just a start, and I will be adding a lot more bells and whistles, and improve search, as I have time.</p>
