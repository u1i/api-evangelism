<p><a href="http://hyp3rl0cal.com/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-486" title="Tag-Cloud-HyperLocal" src="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Tag-Cloud-HyperLocal-300x143.png" alt="" width="300" height="143" align="right" /></a>I needed a way to tell the story of the&nbsp;<a title="CityGrid API" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/">CityGrid API</a>&nbsp;from the perspective of cities across the United States. &nbsp;The way I tell stories is through programming and hacking on APIs, so I needed a project that would allow me to hack on CityGrid&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a title="places" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Places+API">places</a>,&nbsp;<a title="reviews" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Reviews+API">reviews</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="offers" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Offers+API">offers</a>&nbsp;as well as play with different ways of using the&nbsp;<a title="web, mobile and custom advertising" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Ads+by+CityGrid">web, mobile and custom advertising</a>&nbsp;we offer.</p>
<p>So I created&nbsp;<a title="Hyp3rL0cal" href="http://hyp3rl0cal.com/">Hyp3rL0cal</a>, my playground for all things local. &nbsp;&nbsp;Hyp3rL0cal gives me a place to publish projects that I hack on using the CityGrid APIs, while also telling the story of what I build in real-time. &nbsp;You can find local applications I build in a variety of languages, complete with links to&nbsp;<a title="download and fork on Github" href="https://github.com/kinlane">download and fork on Github</a>, and even in some cases I publish Amazon Machine Images (AMI) with the code already loaded and ready to use.</p>
<p>As the API Evangelist at CityGrid I will be touring around the country attending hackathons and conferences, &nbsp;spreading the word about CityGrid, and interacting with developers in different cities. &nbsp;Each city I visit, I will launch a copy of my local directory prototype for that city, and publish to Hyp3rL0cal. &nbsp;This will allow me to see the quality of data available via CityGrid APIs for each city and community I visit.</p>
<p>I have added a&nbsp;<a title="blog to Hyp3rL0cal" href="http://hyp3rl0cal.com/blog/">blog to Hyp3rL0cal&nbsp;</a>where I will tell the story of my projects and travels around the country evangelizing about&nbsp;<a title="CityGrid" href="http://www.citygrid.com/">CityGrid</a>. &nbsp;Come back often, I hope this will be as much of a learning experience for you, as it is for me.</p>
