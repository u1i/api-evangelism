<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/30/graphql-seems-like-we-do-not-want-to-do-the-hard-work-of-api-design/">I wrote a skeptical piece the other day about GraphQL</a>, which I followed up with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/02/i-am-keeping-my-mind-open-and-looking-forward-to-learning-more-about-graphql/">another post saying I would keep an open mind</a>. I've added GraphQL to my regular monitoring of the space, but I don't have its own research area yet, but if the conversation keeps expanding I will. A recent expansion in the GraphQL conversation for me was <a href="http://githubengineering.com/the-github-graphql-api/">Github releasing the GitHub GraphQL API</a>.</p>
<p>In the release blog&nbsp;post, from Github they provide exactly what I'm looking for in the GraphQL conversation--<a href="http://githubengineering.com/the-github-graphql-api/#why">the reasons why they&nbsp;chose to start supporting GraphQL</a>. In their post Github&nbsp;describes some of the challenges API consumers were having with the existing API, which led them down the GraphQL path:</p>
<ul>
<li>sometimes required two or three separate calls to assemble a complete view of a resource</li>
<li>responses simultaneously sent too many data and didn&rsquo;t include data that consumers needed</li>
</ul>
<p>They also talk about some of what they wanted to accomplish:</p>
<ul>
<li>wanted to identify the OAuth scopes required for each endpoint</li>
<li>wanted to be smarter about how our resources were paginated</li>
<li>wanted assurances of type-safety for user-supplied parameters</li>
<li>wanted to generate documentation from our code</li>
<li>wanted to generate clients</li>
</ul>
<p>Github says they <em>"studied a variety of API specifications built to make some of this easier, but we found that none of the standards totally matched our requirements"</em> and felt that <em>"GraphQL represents a massive leap forward for API development. Type safety, introspection, generated </em>documentation <em>and predictable responses benefit both the maintainers and consumers of our platform"</em>. Some interesting points to consider, as I work to understand the benefits GraphQL brings to the table.</p>
<p>I'm still processing the entire story behind their decision to go GraphQL, and will share any more thoughts I'm having in future blog posts. With this major release from Github, I am now keeping an eye out for other providers who are headed in this direction. Hopefully, they will be as transparent about their reasons why as Github has--this kind of storytelling around API design and deployment is important for the rest of the API community to learn from.</p>
