<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/developer-think-tank.png" alt="" width="375" align="right" />The guys over at <a title="Developer Think Tank" href="http://developerthinktank.com/">Developer Think Tank</a> are conducting a survey to measure developer program performance.</p>
<p>Developer Think Tank wants to create a platform to discuss the way to create and run a successful developer program.</p>
<p>So they need all of us API owners, evangelists and advocates to share our knowledge and wisdom about how we conduct business when it comes to our API developer communities.</p>
<p>They are offering some gift certificates in exchange for your time, but we should all show our support, and help them identify best practices around developer program managment.</p>
<p>You can get more information about the <a title="developer program survey" href="http://developerthinktank.com/blog/2011/7/29/research-open-now-measuring-developer-program-performance.html">developer program survey on their blog</a>, or head directly to the <a title="developer survey form" href="http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/600222/Measuring-Developer-Programs">developer survey form</a>.</p>
