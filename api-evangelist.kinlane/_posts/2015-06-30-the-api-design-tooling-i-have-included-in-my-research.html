<p>I am going through each of my research projects, and tightening things down, now that I have them all driven through my new, <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/index.html">master stack of APIs</a>. First up was <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/30/tightening-up-the-organizations-that-are-included-in-my-api-design-research/">the other day I spent time going through the organization I track on as part of my API design research</a>, and today mission was to refine the <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/tools.html">tooling section</a>.</p>
<p>Previously my tooling page was just an alphabetical list of tools, and I wanted to at least group things in a more meaningful way, reflecting how I break them down in my own monitoring system. So I reworked the publishing to allow me to group the tools by tags, resulting in the following list:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>API Blueprint is a documentation-oriented API description language. A couple of semantic assumptions over the plain Markdown. API Blueprint is perfect for designing your Web API and its comprehensive documentation but also for quick prototyping and collaboration. It is easy to learn and even easier to read &ndash; after all it is just a form of plain text. API Blueprint, its parser, and most of its tools are completely open sourced so you don't have to worry about vendor lock-in. This also means you can freely integrate API Blueprint into any type of product, commercial or not.</p>

<p>RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML) is a simple and succinct way of describing practically-RESTful APIs. It encourages reuse, enables discovery and pattern-sharing, and aims for merit-based emergence of best practices. The goal is to help our current API ecosystem by solving immediate problems and then encourage ever-better API patterns. RAML is built on broadly-used standards such as YAML and JSON and is a non-proprietary, vendor-neutral open spec.</p>

APIs, like other web applications, vary greatly in implementation and design, depending on the situation and the problem the application is solving.</p>

<p>I have other resources I need to add to this list, but each one requires a certain amount of love before its ready to be included. Everything here should be openly licensed, providing essential tools API providers, designers, and architects will need. If there is something that you think should be here, let me know, and I will consider adding it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One area I am still working on, is cross linking areas of tooling, potentially with other research areas. For example <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definitions</a> has its own evolving area, and <a href="http://swagger.apievangelist.com/">Swagger</a> does as well. This is why I wanted to retool and break things down by tags, because some of these tags eventually become other projects, and when I break off a new area, I&nbsp; want to keep things connected.</p>
<p>Next I'll give the <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">API design building blocks</a> page a little attention, but it was recently overhauled, so I think I am pretty good there. After that, I need to give my paper API a little love, which allows me to aggregate my design research into a white paper. Once I'm done with that I'll quickly go through some of my other core research like API deployment, management, discovery, and beyond.</p>
