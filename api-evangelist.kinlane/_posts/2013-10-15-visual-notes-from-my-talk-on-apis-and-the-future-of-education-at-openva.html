<p>Audrey and I went up to University of Mary Washington yesterday and participated in the #OpenVa discussion, where I gave a presentation on the importance of APIs and how they will play a significant role in the future of education.</p>
<p>During the talk Giulia Forsythe (<a href="https://twitter.com/giuliaforsythe">@giuliaforsythe</a>) sketched some visual notes that I think are pretty damn cool!</p>

<p>You can view <a href="http://gforsythe.ca/minding-the-future-visual-notes-openva/" target="_blank">her blog post and other sketches on her blog at Minding the Future [Visual Notes} #OpenVA</a>.  You can also find the slides for my talk on Github under <a href="/admin/blog/kinlane.github.io/talks/open-va/future-of-edu/index.html">OpenVA - The Future of Educaiton</a>.</p>
<p>I had a great time brainstorming with everyone up at UMW, and will have more posts in the near future about the other plotting and scheming we did regarding the future of education and APIs.</p>
