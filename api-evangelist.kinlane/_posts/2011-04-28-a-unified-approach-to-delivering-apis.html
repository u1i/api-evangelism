<a title="DeltaCloud API" href="http://incubator.apache.org/deltacloud/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/deltacloud-logo.PNG" alt="" align="right" /></a>Not all <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com">APIs</a> are the same. Even with <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/30/api-technology-rest/">RESTful</a> approaches to delivering APIs they can be quite different.
<p></p>As APIs grow and as we want to be able to connect apps to multiple inputs and endpoints, there's an increasing need to make the process easier, more streamlined, and interoperable.
<p></p>One example of this is within the <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/cloud-computing/">cloud computing</a> industry. When using AmazonEC2 and Rackspace, developers have to write separate code to integrate with each platform.
<p></p>Another example is with social networks, when pulling social streams from <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/facebook/">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/twitter/">Twitter</a>, developers have to develop separate code for each provider as well.
<p></p>An new approach to solving differences between APIs that deliver similar functionality, but use different approaches, is to build a unified API.
<p></p>Unified APIs bring together multiple APIs into a single interface. Two examples of this are:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="DeltaCloud API" href="http://incubator.apache.org/deltacloud/">DeltaCloud API</a> - With the Deltacloud API you can start an instance on an internal cloud, then with the same code start another on <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/amazon/amazon-ec2/">Amazon EC2</a> or Rackspace.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Windsoc" href="http://www.windsoc.co/">Windsoc API</a></strong> - Using Windsoc API developers can access Facebook, Twitter, GoogleBuzz and other social APIs using a single interface.
     </li>
</ul>Unified APIs do a lot of the work for developers, by providing a single interface to build against, as well as compensating for changes between APIs, and different versions of an API.<a title="Windsoc" href="http://www.windsoc.co/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/windsoc.jpg" alt="" align="right" /></a>
<p></p>Cloud computing APIs and social network APIs have been around for a few years now, it makes sense that there is a need for a unified interface.
<p></p>What other industries or types of APIs are in need of an unified API?
