<p>I am working my way through <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?gp=&amp;SID=c441be5b4dae3a7bcd23a1c7b98bbf60&amp;mc=true&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title45/45tab_02.tpl">Title 45</a>, which is the principle set of rules and regulations issued by&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Federal agencies of the United States" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_agencies_of_the_United_States">federal agencies of the United States</a>&nbsp;regarding public welfare. I've made my way through the <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=938e08839465e82e2c30c3bd4a359ce2&amp;node=pt45.1.164&amp;rgn=div5%23se45.1.164_1402#sp45.1.164.c">security standards</a>, and the <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=938e08839465e82e2c30c3bd4a359ce2&amp;node=pt45.1.164&amp;rgn=div5%23se45.1.164_1402#sp45.1.164.d">breach notification</a> portions, but can't help but feel that much of the "<a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=938e08839465e82e2c30c3bd4a359ce2&amp;node=pt45.1.164&amp;rgn=div5%23se45.1.164_1402#se45.1.164_1502">uses and disclosures of protected health information</a>" section should be closely evaluated for consideration beyond healthcare.</p>

<p>I am working on each portion of this and considering how I can add. I do not see any reason why this can't be applied to other areas of our information, like social, electricity, and beyond. I get that health care information has been granted a special place in our digital worlds, but I think we need to asking ourselves where else this might also apply.</p>
<p>It is tough to digest this in its full legal form. This is why I work to break them down as plain English building blocks that I can include alongside my research. If we can make turn this into an easy to read checklist that any data steward could use as best practices when crafting their own approach tot he disclosure of our information, maybe more companies will step up to the plate.</p>
