<p>API service provider <a title="APIphany" href="http://apiphany.com/">APIphany</a> followed <a title="some of my advice" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/10/29/api-developer-login-using-github/">some of my advice</a> this last week, and added <a title="support for Github, Facebook and Twitter in all of their developer portals" href="http://apiphany.com/blog/support-for-github-facebook-and-twitter-accounts-in-our-developer-portals">support for Github, Facebook and Twitter in all of their developer portals</a>.</p>
<p>Using oAuth from Twitter, Facebook and especially Github for API providers, just makes sense in this online world.  As a user, I don&rsquo;t want to create yet another login--I want to pick from my preferred social network.</p>
<p>It is good to see <a title="APIphany" href="http://apiphany.com/">APIphany</a> make sure their customers deliver friction-less onboarding for their developers, who are building mobile and web applications on top of their APIphany powered APIs.</p>
