<p>I recently added a <a href="http://cybersecurity.apievangelist.com/">new area of research to API Evangelist focused on cybersecurity</a>. I added this area of research not because APIs are being used to hack systems, which does happen occasionally. I did this because I wanted to better tune into this area because APIs are being applied by all sides (are there sides?) to communicate, evaluate cybersecurity events, and spread their message--which is a significant part of what is cybersecurity.</p>
<p>When APIs aren't properly secured, and a breach occurs, I consider this a security topic&nbsp;and file it under <a href="http://security.apievangelist.com/">my API security research</a>. If something occurs in the wider global security theater, I file it under my cybersecurity research. This research doesn't always directly touch on APIs, but in <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/why-twitter-was-the-platform-of-choice-for-ripping-apart-the-nsa-dump">many cases like the recent DNC hacks APIs are being used to analyze, study, share stories, and communicate around these often ongoing cybesecurity events</a>.</p>
<p>I am seeing APIs often being used as part of the levers pulled when it comes to the theater of cybersecurity, whether its anonymous bitcoin ransom payments, <a href="https://twitter.com/guccifer_2">Guccifer 2.0 spreading the story of a recent breach of Twitter</a>, or researchers doing their forensic studies. As with other areas of my API monitoring, establishing a dedicated research project helps me tune in closer to what is going on, identify key actors, and better understand the role of APIs in the fast-growing world of cybersecurity.</p>
