<p>I wish every time you came across facts and statistics in any news story, blog post, report, and beyond, there would be an interactive experience like you get with <a href="http://www.census.gov/quickfacts/dashboard/SEX255215/45,32">the US Census Bureau's QuickFacts tool</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>QuickFacts provides statistics for all states and counties, and for cities and towns with a population of 5,000 or more, and provides everything I think you need to make the case behind any facts and statistics you are presenting.</p>
<p>Using the tool you get a table, chart, map, data download, email results, and share via popular social networks as well as embeddable tooling. The QuickFacts experience should be a default for all storytelling around open data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Census team has clearly worked very hard to make a wealth of very complicated data much more accessible, usable, and easily understood through proven approaches to telling stories using open data.</p>
<p>If you are in the business of publishing open data and APIs&nbsp;and building analytics and visualization tools, follow the lead of the US Census Bureau, and develop easy to use API tooling like the QuickFacts solution.</p>
