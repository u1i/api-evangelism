<p>As the Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API Evangelist, I get asked why I would be an evangelist for technology in a dying industry.  Print and Publishing.</p>
<p>My primary argument is: Through new technology such as cloud computing, social media, and mobile the print and publishing industry will be redefined.  We won't even recognize it as the old beast.</p>
<p>One example of this is <a href="http://www.shapeways.com" target="_blank">Shapeways</a>.  Shapeways turns 3D designs and drawings to tangible products through 3D printing. <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/shapeways/shapeways-logo.png" alt="" width="400" align="right" /> You can choose from their pre-defined creators to build proven products, partner with other designers to create a product or upload your own designs to the Shapeways platform.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.shapeways.com" target="_self">Shapeways</a> will check your 3D model that you upload to make sure it can be printed properly before sending to their production facility.</p>
<p>Once in production, the 3D model in your digital file will be printed layer by layer using one of four 3D printing machines &amp; technologies:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_laser_sintering" target="_blank">Selective Laser Sintering (SLS)</a> </strong>- SLS is an additive manufacturing technique that uses a high power laser to fuse small particles of plastic, metal, ceramic, or glass powders into a mass that has a desired 3-dimensional shape.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereolithography" target="_blank">Stereolithography (SLA) </a></strong>- Stereolithography is an additive manufacturing process using a vat of liquid UV-curable photopolymer "resin" and a UV laser to build parts a layer at a time. On each layer, the laser beam traces a part cross-section pattern on the surface of the liquid resin.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fused_deposition_modeling" target="_blank">Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) </a></strong>- FDM works on an "additive" principle by laying down material in layers. A plastic filament or metal wire is unwound from a coil and supplies material to an extrusion nozzle which can turn on and off the flow.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminated_object_manufacturing" target="_blank">Laminate Object Manufacturing (LOM)</a> </strong>- LOM is a rapid prototyping system that layers adhesive-coated paper, plastic, or metal laminates are successively glued together and cut to shape with a knife or laser cutter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plastic objects are printed and delivered in 10 working days, and metal objects take 14 working days to arrive.</p>
<p>Cloud print Application Programming Interfaces (API) will allow web and mobile applications to interface with new print and manufacturing technology spanning facilities world wide.</p>
<p>Cloud print and manufacturing APIs will give existing publishing and manufacturing industries new life, and invent entirely new forms of printing, prototyping, and manufacturing we haven't even conceived.</p>
