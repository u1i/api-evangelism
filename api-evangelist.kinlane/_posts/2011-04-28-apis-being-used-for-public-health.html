<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/foursquare/foursquare-health-api-usage.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /><a title="Foursquare API Innovation" href="http://blog.foursquare.com/2011/04/28/api-highlight-check-in-and-save-yourself-from-a-stomachache/">Foursquare just highlighted an innovative use of their API</a>, that alerts people to public health issues.
<p></p><a title="DontEat.at" href="http://donteat.at/">DontEat.at</a> is a service which merges city health code records with the <a title="Foursquare API" href="https://developer.foursquare.com/">Foursquare API</a> to warn people via text message, when they check into a restaurant that has recorded health code violations.
<p></p>An excellent example of the power of APIs for mashing up data and providing real-time value that can even be used for the public good.
