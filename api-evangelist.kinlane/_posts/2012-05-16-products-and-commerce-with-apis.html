<p>I am really starting to see <a title="my early visions of the Internet" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2012/05/03/apis-help-deliver-on-early-commerce-visions-of-the-internet/">my early visions of the Internet</a>&nbsp;coming together.  In my mind I see an interconnected world of products and commerce, where every business has an API.</p>
<p>APIs finally seem to be maturing, reaching a point where they can deliver at the scale and reliability we need, to really make this happen.  Three good examples of this are:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="The StructuredRetailProducts.com API" href="http://www.structuredretailproducts.com/tab/api.html">The StructuredRetailProducts.com API</a></strong> - Providing to access to over 3 million individual product listings from 1700+ companies, representing total sales of over &pound;3,382 billion and counting. Access 15+ years of product and market data across 72 different countries at the click of a button and get the latest data on sales volumes, activity levels, and market share.</li>
<li><strong><a title="The Elastic Path Digital Commerce API" href="http://www.elasticpath.com/">The Elastic Path Digital Commerce API</a></strong> - A Digital Commerce Engine&trade; for driving any e-commerce experience, on any device or platform, allowing companies to build compelling product experiences, leverage new business models, and extend their reach to emerging end points.</li>
<li><strong><a title="Stripe API" href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe API</a></strong> - A complete payment platform, that handles everything, including storing cards, subscriptions, and direct payouts to your bank account, without a merchant account or gateway.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you look through those three APIs, you see the simplicity of REST + JSON, plus the essential building blocks to support developers, and the power and scalability you need to drive commerce in the API driven economy.</p>
