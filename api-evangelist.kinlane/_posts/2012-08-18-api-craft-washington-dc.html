<p>Continuing my API Craft road show, I landed in Washington DC for the second week in August.  As I planned my trip to the nations capital, I planted the seeds for an API Craft DC version.</p>
<p>I chose a popular H Street watering hole, the <a title="Queen Vic" href="http://www.thequeenvicdc.com/">Queen Vic</a> to host the event, and in tune with <a title="API Craft PDX" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/07/20/definition-of-api-craft/">API Craft PDX</a> and <a title="API Craft SFO" href="/2012/08/18/api-craft-san-francisco/">API Craft SFO</a> about 10-15 people showed up to drink beer and discuss APIs, DC Style.</p>

<p>I was impressed with not just the energy for APIs in DC, but the startup buzz occurring in a city, many like to associate with slow moving government bureaucracy.  API Craft DC brought out one API Service Provider <a title="APIphany" href="http://apiphany.com/">APIphany</a>, and an assortment of companies that contract for the government and several other private companies including API geeks from <a title="QVC" href="http://www.qvc.com/">QVC</a>.</p>
<p>API Craft DC has triggered requests for three new gatherings that I will be planning, including API Craft NYC, API Craft Philadelphia and API Craft Atlanta.  Dates coming as soon as I can.</p>
