<p>As the number of available <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definitions</a> out there grows, I am increasingly coming across variations of APIs that I already have included in my <a href="http://theapistack.com/">API Stack</a>. It can be tedious to try and sync these with existing copies, so I wanted to take a look and see if there was anything already available out there, that would help provide a diff for either OpenAPI Spec, RAML, or API Blueprint.</p>
<p>The most common one I found referenced was <a href="https://github.com/civisanalytics/swagger-diff">a Ruby one for OpenAPI Spe</a>c from&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/civisanalytics">Civis Analytics</a>. Next, I found a pretty <a href="https://zallek.github.io/swagger-diff/">interesting web tool</a>, which provides its <a href="https://github.com/zallek/swagger-diff/">Node.js source code on Github</a>, including a CLI edition. After these two solutions, I only found <a href="https://github.com/myexpr/raml-diff">one more for RAML</a>, but couldn't find anything for API Blueprint.</p>
<p>I wanted to think beyond just the common API definition formats&nbsp;and look for diff tools that would work just for JSON. I found <a href="https://github.com/andreyvit/json-diff">Diff</a> which was pretty interesting, as well as <a href="https://github.com/janmonschke/diffsync">DiffSync</a> which provided a real-time&nbsp;diff for JSON. I haven't tried any of them out, I am just trying to compile a list of what is out there&nbsp;before I dive into what their capabilities are.</p>
<p>I have a master database of API definitions where I can just import API definitions that I find, and it will add any new paths, parameters, and schemas it comes across. I would much rather have the ability to just run each version through a diff tool, and be able to select which elements I want to have merged. For now, I will just implement a custom layer to my API monitoring system, but I would like to see API diff move forward similar to we saw the conversation evolve with the introduction of&nbsp;<a href="https://apitransformer.com/">API Transformer</a>.</p>
