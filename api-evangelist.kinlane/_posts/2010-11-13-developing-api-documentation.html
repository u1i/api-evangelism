<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/peter-gruenbaum/0/41b/695" target="_blank">Peter Gruenbaum</a> of <a href="http://www.sdkbridge.com/" target="_blank">SDK Bridge</a> shared an article in the company's November newsletter that resonated with some of the work I've been doing recently -- creating API documentation for the Mimeo Connect REST Print API.<p></p>
The article is titled <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/gg309172.aspx" target="_blank">A Coder's Guide to Writing API Documentation</a> and appeared in MSDN Magazine.<p></p>
Gruenbaum says that writing good API documentation requires the four components:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Overview:</strong> Explaining what advantages developers have in using the platform, and in some cases, providing an architectural description of the platform.</li>
	<li><strong>Getting started:</strong> Helping the developer get started, in the form of step-by-step tutorials or simpler walkthroughs.</li>
	<li><strong>Sample code:</strong> Providing well-commented code samples that developers can build on.</li>
	<li><strong>Reference material:</strong> Providing detailed information about each class, member, function or XML element.</li>
</ul>
I have been writing sample PHP code while authenticating and writing calls against every endpoint on the REST Print API this week.<p></p>
I have five developers interested in integrating the API into their applications.   So I have been working on and overview and a getting started guide to our API.<p></p>
I have been keeping reference materials to each web service on a wiki as I play with and learn more about our API.<p></p>
Seems like I already have a good start, and seeing Gruenbaum's list of what makes up good API documentation validates where I chose to start with our API documentation this week.
