<p>During <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice in New York City</a>, there was an awesome gathering of developer evangelists at the <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/dashboard">Tumblr</a> offices, for the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/nycevangelists/events/104141492/" target="_blank">NYC Evangelist Meetup</a>.</p>
<p>I got the chance to hang out with several evangelist I know online, but have never met in person. &nbsp;We drank beers, ate pizza and talked about all things evangelist, evangelism, advocacy and hopefully some normal shit too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for having me over everyone! &nbsp;Have you ever seen so many evangelists in one room?</p>
