<p>Building on what Orlando (<a href="https://twitter.com/orliesaurus">@orliesaurus</a>) brings up in his story on <a href="https://medium.com/@orliesaurus/the-missing-brick-in-the-api-industry-1163a9c25791">the missing brick in the API Industry</a>, we are missing a common place to discovery and share common API designs--<a href="http://theapistack.com">something I've been working hard on with my API Stack</a>. As I read <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2015/06/23/container-apps-now-available-in-the-azure-marketplace/">this piece from Microsoft Azure on&nbsp;Container Apps now available in the Azure Marketplace</a>, I'm reminded of how robust the app deployment, and management ecosystem has become with the containerization evolution, but when it comes to API deployment we are still way behind the times.</p>
<p>There are numerous containerized marketplaces of apps available out there today, what I am looking for is the same thing, but for common API patterns. After over 10 years of solid design, deployment, and management of web API patterns, we should have a wealth of API design patterns to choose from. I shouldn't have to launch my own user API, or image API, there should be the WordPress of APIs out there, ready for me to deploy.</p>
<p>These APIs should be available with common API patterns, well defined using <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> and <a href="http://apiblueprint.org">API Blueprint</a>, available in a variety of server side languages from PHP to Go. I should be able to search, and browse these APIs, and with a single click of a button deploy into my containerized architecture of choice, from Amazon to Google, and Microsoft to the Raspberry Pi in my living room--<a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-button">think Heroku deploy button</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://theapistack.com/companies.html">Ok, back to work on defining the common public APIs out there on my API Stack</a>, could someone please get to work on this containerized API marketplace? I have a number of standardized API definitions I can share to get you going, and happy to focus on crafting any new ones you need, derived from common patterns I'm finding across my API Stack work.</p>
<p>There is a reason we have the bespoke API design, and deployment way of life--everyone is lacking the marketplace of ready-to-go, containerized APis, that individuals, businesses, institutions, and government agencies will need for success in the API economy.</p>
