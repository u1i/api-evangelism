<p>I was profiling the <a href="https://developer.dailymotion.com">video sharing API Dailymotion</a> the other day, going through their developer area and profiling their API operations. One of the things I<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/06/my-ideal-profile-of-companies-who-are-doing-interesting-things-with-apis/"> do as part of the profiling of any company</a>, is checkout how they execute their support.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.dailymotion.com/support">Dailymotion employs two very common building blocks for their platform support</a>, including an API specific Twitter handle, and good ol fashion email&mdash;both pretty proven approaches. However Dailymotion also employs a third aspect to thier API support, by recommending you head over to Stack Overflow for some community support.</p>
<p>Using <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> in this way is not that original, I see numerous API providers doing this, the part I found interesting was their reference to getting Dailymotion API support via Stack Overflow as, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"ask the stack!"</span> I like that, I think it reflects what Stack Overflow is to the API developer community, and was an elegant way to send API developers off your site, to get the support they need.</p>
