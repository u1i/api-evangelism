<p>It&rsquo;s been 2 weeks since New York City was hit by hurricane Sandy, and while things aren&rsquo;t back to normal, everyone is beginning to look to the future, and starting the process of moving past the devastating storm.</p>
<p>With this spirit in mind, we&rsquo;ve confirmed dates for the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a> conference! Lock in&nbsp;<strong><span>February 21st and 22nd, 2013</span></strong>and make sure you are in New York City for the reboot of the communities own API industry conference.</p>

<p>So far it looks like we&rsquo;ll have most of the session, panel and keynote lineup as in the original schedule with just a few minor adjustments. With the new dates, we&rsquo;ll reboot ticket sales and start the countdown.</p>
