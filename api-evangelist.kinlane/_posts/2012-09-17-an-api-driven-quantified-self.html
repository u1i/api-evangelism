<p>I&rsquo;m immersing myself into the fascinating new world of the <a title="Quantified Self" href="http://quantifiedself.com/about/">Quantified Self</a> (QS).  If you are not familiar with what QS is, according to Wikipedia:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Quantified Self is a movement to incorporate technology into data acquisition on aspects of a person's daily life in terms of inputs (e.g. food consumed, quality of surrounding air), states (e.g. mood, arousal, blood oxygen levels), and performance (mental and physical).</em></p>
<p>As I do with other areas, I start my research by doing a roundup of companies who offer QS products and services--which helps me define the space. Within an hour I easily found 50+ QS device manufacturers, some of which were complete with API driven integration platforms-- way too many to list in a single roundup, but here are a couple of better known companies:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Fitbit" href="http://www.fitbit.com/">Fitbit</a></strong> - Fitbit is a health and fitness tracking device</li>
<li><strong><a title="Runkeeper" href="http://runkeeper.com/">RunKeeper</a></strong> - Runkeeper is a device for tracking<span>, measuring, and improving your fitness</span></li>
<li><strong><a title="Withings" href="http://www.withings.com/">Withings</a></strong> - Withings provides connected body scales, blood pressure and baby monitors</li>
<li><strong><a title="Zeo" href="http://www.myzeo.com/sleep/">Zeo</a></strong> - Zeo has sleep tracking and management devices and apps</li>
</ul>
<p>These QS platforms represent a whole new opportunity for the API industry, one that will drive the next generation of healthcare innovation.  Self-quantification starts with data collection, followed by visualization, then cross-referencing and the discovery of correlations--all three opportunites for APIs.</p>
<p>Devices can use APIs via cell and wifi to transmit data for collection and storage, while also allowing app developers to use the same APIs to help end-users manage and visualize their data. Then, when appropriate, use the same APIs providing access to other systems and providers who can then cross-reference and discover correlations within individual or groups of users.</p>
<p>It is exciting to think about the possibilities around QS.  New ways to gather data about our health and the environment around us in real-time, but also be able to understand this data in the most meaningful way possible, in a way that impacts the most important thing to us--our health!</p>
<p><strong>Devices + APIs + Cloud = Exciting Opportunities!</strong></p>
