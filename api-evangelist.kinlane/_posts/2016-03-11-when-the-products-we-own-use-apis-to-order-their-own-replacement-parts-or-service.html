<p><a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/03/09/amazons-new-smart-pitcher-is-a-piece-of-a-larger-p.aspx">I was reading a post on Amazon's new SMART(Surveillance Marketed As Revolution Techonology) water pitcher</a>, which is more about Amazon's new connected device partner commerce strategy, than it is about this individual connected device example. The quote from the story explains the strategy pretty well.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Last week, Amazon.com curiously devoted an entire press release to a water pitcher. But not just any water pitcher. Rather, Amazon detailed a new partnership with Brita to bring consumers the $45 smart Brita Infinity Pitcher. Just connect it to your Wi-Fi, and the Brita Infinity Pitcher will automatically track how much water passes through its filter. Then, using Amazon Dash Replenishment, it'll automatically order a new filter when a replacement is needed.</em></p>
<p>So now, your pitchers orders its replacement filters, your lights will order new bulbs, your printer will order more of those wonderfully expensive print cartridges for you. At a consumer level, most of this seems pretty lazy to me, and unnecessary, but then again, I do not represent mainstream society in any way. Having your common devices in your life, order up their replacement parts, or even servicing, seems pretty attractive, but is something I'm sure we won't consider the downside until its way to late.</p>
<p>Ok, let's stop for a second. There is your new startup idea Jane / Joe entrepreneur, "the Angie's List + Dash Replenishment == service scheduling API platform". My cable modem calls for a service provider when the modem needs replaced with newer model, my refrigerator and dishwasher call repair(wo)man when they are not running at optimal levels. When you get your funding, make sure and cut me in for a point or two. ;-)</p>
<p>Well, as with 96% of this API circus, I'm not highlighting this because I think it is a good idea, I am talking about because it is happening, and will begin impacting the rest of us. As more of our everyday objects are being connected to the Internet, I want to understand the technical, business, and politics aspects of what is happening behind the scenes. Honestly the consumer vision of this doesn't really get me fully interested, but I could see it being used in some pretty interesting ways in a commercial, and industrial environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/oc/dash-replenishment-service">Amazon Dash Replenishment</a> is an interesting layer of any home, or small business, and as an API driven vehicle for commerce. I'm sure Amazon is going to do very well with it. I will keep an eye on what they are doing, as well as in any other implementations in a commercial and industrial settings, and keep thinking about what is possible, both the good, and the bad.</p>
