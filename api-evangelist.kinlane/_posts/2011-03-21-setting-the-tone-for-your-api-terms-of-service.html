<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/terms-legal.jpg" alt="" width="275" align="right" />I wanted to establish a base <a title="Terms of Service" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=150">Terms of Service</a> for my API area.
<p></p>So I went and read the API terms of service from 15 top APIs
<p></p>I found the opening paragraph says a lot about how a company approaches their API.
<p></p>Here are the opening paragraphs for the top 15 API terms of service I came across:

At the same time, we aim to strike a balance between encouraging interesting development and protecting both Twitter's and users' rights.
<p></p>So, we've come up with a set of Developer Rules of the Road ("Rules") that describe the policies and philosophy around what type of innovation is permitted with the content and information shared on Twitter.
