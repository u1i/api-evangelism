<p></p>The site also provides social networking functionality such as feeds, followers and a network graph to display how developers work on their versions of a repository.
<p></p>Github provides two main tools that can be used in an API area:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Github Repositories" href="http://help.github.com/create-a-repo/">Github Repositories</a></strong> - Git code repositories for various supporting areas of an API
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Gists" href="https://gist.github.com/">Gists</a></strong> - Gist are a simple way to share snippets of code
     </li>
</ul>There are several ways to use Github repositories and Gists in an API area:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Documentation</strong> - Display example calls, requests, and responses using Gists
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Code Samples</strong> - Display code samples using Gists, and package up entire sets of code samples using Github repositories
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Code Libraries</strong> - Package up official and community generated API code libraries as Github repositories
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Prototypes</strong> - Publish API prototypes as Github repositories
     </li>
</ul><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/github/github-round.png" alt="" width="160" align="right" /> Github provides a way for API owners to manage a large number of code samples, libraries and prototypes, in a way that allows developers to fork and contribute code as part of the community.
<p></p>The social spects of Github extends a API community to the existing, vibrant developer community that exists at Github.
<p></p>Its easier for an API to participate within the existing Github developer community, rather then expect developers to come and participate in a community built around the API.
