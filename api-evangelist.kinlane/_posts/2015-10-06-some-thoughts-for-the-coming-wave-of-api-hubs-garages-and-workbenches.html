<p>I've been getting demos of some pretty interesting new work spaces meant for API architects, and designers. Examples of this are <a href="http://apigarage.com/">API Garage</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.reprezen.com/">RepreZen API Studio</a>, and the recent <a href="https://swaggerhub.com">SwaggerHub</a>. These are just some of the API life-cycle solutions I'm seeing emerge recently, where companies are trying to provide API design, development, and deployment solutions in a single, tidy, work space.</p>
<p>Now that the API life-cycle has expanded beyond just API management, deployment, and design, into testing, monitoring, security, and beyond, I predict these types of API work-spaces that span multiple stops along the API life-cycle will become common place. To help prime the pump, and ensure there will be more viable products launched, I wanted to share a few thoughts on what these solution providers should consider as part of their offerings.</p>
<p>Here are some of my scribbles while drinking an IPA at my local bar:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Definitions -</strong> Speak Swagger, API Blueprint, Postman Collections, and other common API definition formats, and allow for the importing and exporting of them at every step.</li>
<li><strong>Provide APIs -</strong> Make sure you provide APIs to all the functionality available within the workspace -- paying the whole API thing forward.</li>
<li><strong>Consume APIs -</strong> Make sure you allow the consumption of APIs, from within the interface, either as part of http client, or add-ons.</li>
<li><strong>Plug-in Framework -</strong> Allow some sort of extensibility of the work space, allowing 3rd parties to augment the platform via plugins.</li>
<li><strong>Play Well With Others -</strong> Please play nice with other service providers, all of this works because of interoperability, and I should be able to use the services I need via my work space.</li>
<li><strong>Search -</strong> Provide a comprehensive search, allowing me to discovery across everything I do within a work space, via a comprehensive history</li>
<li><strong>Notebook -</strong> Give me a notebook for storing my work, draft APIs, and other items I gather through my work, allowing me to come back and re-use work from the past.</li>
<li><strong>Use Github -</strong> Make sure Github is a first class citizen within the workspace, allowing me to import, and publish all my work to Github -- think orchestration, not just import and publish.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Developer Friendly </strong>- Make sure tht the work space isn't just for developers, and anyone can come in and participate throughout the API life-cycle.</li>
<li><strong>Provide a HTTP Client -</strong> Make sure there is a built-in, or embeddable HTTP client, so get building one, partner with existing, or acquire one you like.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few of my thoughts as I received a demo of one API work space, and was reading about a couple of other new products. After scribbling these thoughts, I sat back, drank a another pint of IPA, and contemplated the role of these types of work spaces in the future of the API industry. I predict there will be a wave of these API work spaces emerge in coming months, providing their own take on exactly what the API life-cycle looks like, and want to help developers standardize and be successful.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to playing with all the new work space, and hoping there will be at least one to emerge that suits my unique needs as the API Evangelist. I will need all of the elements listed above, or I probably won't be working in there full-time. &nbsp;</p>
