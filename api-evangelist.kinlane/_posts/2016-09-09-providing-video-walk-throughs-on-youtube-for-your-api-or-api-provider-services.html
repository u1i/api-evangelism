<p>I like Postman's approach to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCocudCGVb3MmhWQ1aoIgUQw">using Youtube for providing walk-through's for specific actions users will want to take in their API client service</a>. All of their video walk-throughs are very simple, straightforward, and seem to speak to specific things that users are going to want to tackle when design, developing, or even integrating with an API.</p>
<p>Another thing I wanted to highlight, is that I came across <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCocudCGVb3MmhWQ1aoIgUQw">Postman's Youtube Account</a> because I saw <a href="https://twitter.com/postmanclient">@postmanclient</a> tweet a link in response to a specific question, from a user about a specific need they had. This demonstrates for me, the importance of weaving video walk-throughs with your regular feedback loop and FAQ's, making sure you have video answers to the things your users are most asking about most--a great way to scale your support, while also increasing your SEO and SMM reach. #winwin</p>
<p>I am not a big video watcher. I have lists of videos I should be watching, and rarely ever do, but I do know quite a few people who are, and having easily available video how-to resources, can score big points. Especially if you have a well thought out catalog of videos that match the common questions users are asking right at your fingertips--allowing you to Tweet, post to Facebook and LinkedIn, or use as part of conversations around integration on Github, in the moment.</p>
