<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/finger-pointing.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" />How To Get Your Grandma, Mother, Daughter and Sister to Understand APIs? You stop using gendered approaches when explaining what an API is.  I&rsquo;m not going to cite any of the past or recent examples of this (you know who you are). And I don&rsquo;t care <em>"how you didn&rsquo;t even mean to do this"</em>, when you wrote your API example.  There really isn&rsquo;t a line between sexism and ignorant sexism.</p>
<p>If you really want everyone to understand what an API is, provide well written, plain english examples, that are framed around solving a problem your grandma, mother, daughter or or sister will understand--using problems they truly face in their lives.</p>
<p>It really is that simple.  As long as you are using gendered terms to describe what we are doing, you are raising the barrier to entry. &nbsp;And when you do this, you are talking down to a person and making them feel small, stupid and all the other power trips that go with sexism.  And yes, those thing are still there even if you <em>"didn&rsquo;t mean to do it"</em>.</p>
<p>So let &lsquo;s make sure and keep API examples about solving problems and putting the valuable API resources to use, and not about gender, and get EVERYONE on board.</p>
<p>End of story! And if ever step over this line, call me out. I welcome it, cause I'm not perfect or exempt.</p>
