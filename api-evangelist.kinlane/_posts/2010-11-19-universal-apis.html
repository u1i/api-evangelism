The opportunity to develop Universal APIs or Aggregated APIs that bring together common web services into a single source is growing.<p></p>
One example of API aggregation is the <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/11/17/deltacloud-review/" target="_blank">Deltacloud</a> which provide aggregated access to multiple cloud computing platforms such as <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/rackspace/" target="_blank">Rackspace</a> and <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/amazon/amazon-ec2/" target="_blank">Amazon EC2</a> via a single web service.<p></p>
Aggregation of APIs opens up opportunities to provide redundancy, deliver caching and other ways of improve API availability and performance.<p></p>
Aggregators will eventually commoditize certain API services such as geo-location, IP address look-up, storage, and computing and will create markets for services such as Amazon EC2 Spot Instances.  This will create competition and ultimately drive down pricing and create opportunities for bulk discounts.<p></p>
API aggregation markets will lead the way for interoperability and standards among API service providers, make integration easier for developers and make it easier to manage the growing number of APIs that are being used in application development.
