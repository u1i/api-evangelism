<p>I&rsquo;m fascinated by the rise of Twitter bots. Little automated bundles of social media joy, built to spew mostly nonsense, but everyone once in a while you find nuggets of wisdom in the Twitter API fueled bots. Personally I have never built a Twitter bot, only because I don&rsquo;t need another distraction, and I can see the addictive potential of bot design.</p>
<p>My partner in crime Audrey Watters (<a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a>), who has hands on experience building her own bots, said something interesting the other day while we were partaking in our daily IPAs&mdash;the wordnik APIs it the base building block of any Twitter bot.</p>
<p>Sure enough, when you search &ldquo;<a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=twitter+bots+wordnik">twitter bots wordnik</a>&rdquo; on the Googlez, you get a wide variety of python, nobde.js, php, and other recipes for building Twitter bots, with almost all of them using the Wordnik API as the core linguistics engine for the bot.</p>
<p>Two overlaps with other stories I written here. 1) <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/04/twitter-api-is-gateway-drug-for-internet-of-things/">I feel the Twitter API holds a lot of potential as a training ground for IoT connectivity</a>, and 2) I think APIs, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/01/i-find-it-interesting-that-wordnik-created-the-api-definition-format-swagger/">specifically the Wordnik API, and the work to come out of Wordnik, like Swagger, has a significant role to play</a> in the future of the Internet.</p>
<p>I know many of us technologists have grand visions of where the Internet is going, and would like things to happen faster. but I think the &ldquo;smart&rdquo; everything we are looking for is going to take some time, and is something you can see playing out slowly in things like Twitter bot design. I&rsquo;m sure there are many negative incarnations, but many of the Twitter bots I&rsquo;ve seen have been interesting little nuggets of API driven (Twitter &amp; Wordnik) chaos, driving us towards an unknown, but definitely Internet connected, online world.</p>
