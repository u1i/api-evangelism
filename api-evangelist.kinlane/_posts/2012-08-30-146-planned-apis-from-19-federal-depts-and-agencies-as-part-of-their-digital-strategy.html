<p>I don't know about you, but I'm starting to get excited about the potential here.  With almost 20 departments and agencies on board, and 166 APIs planned--there is a lot of potential for the other 226 departments and agencies to see the potential and get on board.</p>
<p>This list of systems are generated programmatically using each department or agencies machine readable digital strategy.  I didn't have to compile this by hand, which shows the potential of the digital strategy to become a federal API discovery platform. &nbsp;You can view the <a title="real-time version of systems pulled from each department or agencies digital strategy" href="/federal_government_digital_strategy_systems.php">real-time version of systems pulled from each department or agencies digital strategy</a>, which gets updated every night when I run my monitoring script.</p>
