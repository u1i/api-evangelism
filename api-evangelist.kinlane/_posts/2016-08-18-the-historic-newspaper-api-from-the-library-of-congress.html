<p>It always bums me out that the cool kid startup APIs always get the lion share of the attention when it comes to APIs in the tech news. Which I guess makes it my responsibility to show the ACTUAL cool kid APIs, like <a href="http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/about/api/">the&nbsp;Chronicling America API from The Library of Congress</a>, which provides access to information about historic newspapers and select digitized newspaper pages.</p>
<p>The Library of Congress provides APIs for&nbsp;<a href="http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/about/api/#search">searching</a>&nbsp;the newspaper directory and digitized page contents using <a href="http://www.opensearch.org/Home">OpenSearch</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/about/api/#autosuggest">auto suggesting</a>&nbsp;of newspaper titles, <a href="http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/about/api/#link">links</a>&nbsp;using a stable URL pattern, and&nbsp;<a href="http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/about/api/#linked-data">JSON</a>&nbsp;views of all newspaper resources. They also provide&nbsp;<a href="http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/about/api/#linked-data">linked data</a>&nbsp;allowing you to&nbsp;<span>process and analyze newspaper information with "conceptual precision" (oooooh I like that), as well as&nbsp;</span><a href="http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/about/api/#bulk-data">bulk data</a>&nbsp;for your deeper research needs.</p>
<p>I wish that ALL newspapers had APIs like the <a href="https://developer.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a> and <a href="http://open-platform.theguardian.com/">The Guardian</a> do, and information was available to the public by default, and that everything was automatically synced to any archive or collection that was interested in it, like the Libary of Congress. I know that newspapers are having a hard time in the digital age, and I can't help but feel that APIs would help them evolve, and shift until they find their voice in the digital age.</p>
