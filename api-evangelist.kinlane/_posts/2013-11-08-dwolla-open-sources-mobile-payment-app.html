<p>Every API provider should provide code samples in a variety of languages, helping developers get up and running as fast as possible.</p>
<p>Dwolla is taking this one step further and <a href="http://blog.dwolla.com/for-developers-an-open-source-mobile-wallet-built-on-the-dwolla-network/">providing a fully functional iOS app that developers can fork, tweak and use</a> as they wish.</p>
<p>I've talked about what I call "starter kits" before, when I <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/09/17/providing-code-libraries-is-not-enough-for-your-api/">showcased Google+ sample social applications in a variety of languages</a>, but it is still something I don't see from very many API providers.</p>
<p>Complete mobile applications is a great way to showcase what a complete API integration will look like, helping developers see the end goal clearly, while also teaching them best practices.</p>
<p>Do you have any applications you could open source and allow developers to reverse engineer? Or maybe an app you could developer to show developers what is possible!</p>
