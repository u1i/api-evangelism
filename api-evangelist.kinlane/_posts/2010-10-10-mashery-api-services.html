You can leverage Mashery's platform to get an API planned, deployed, and into operation quickly.  Mashery makes a pretty compelling <a href="http://www.mashery.com/solution/buy_vs_build.html">buy versus build argument when planning for your API</a>.<p></p>
<a href="http://www.mashery.com">Mashery</a> provides a wide array of tools in three distinct areas:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>API Management</strong> building blocks like API registration, credential management, usage throttling and business rules.</li>
	<li><strong>Metrics and Reporting</strong> building blocks like API usage, developer activity, systems status, and real-time insights into API operations.</li>
	<li><strong>Community Management</strong> building blocks for blogs, wiki, general content management, change control, and forums.</li>
</ul>
Mashery is definitely the leader in this space.  It has a robust set of API management features as well as a service level agreement and extensive API support portal.<p></p>
Mashery also understands the <a href="http://developer.mashery.com/">API developer network</a> to enable deeper integration of their API services.<p></p>
Mashery's platform, collective experience, resources, and support makes it enticing to use them as a platform for launching and growing your API.
