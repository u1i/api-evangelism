<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/05/27/a-cleaner-simpler-example-of-api-to-spa/">I wrote about a simpler example of API to SPA the other day, continuing my journey for apps, services, and tooling that easily deploys a Single Page App (SPA) or light-weight web and mobile clients from a single API, or many APIs</a>. One of the reason I am so transparent about my ideas, is because I depend on my audience to help educate me about what is out there--one of my readers, who is always schooling me, pointed me at&nbsp;<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jdubray/reacall/src">Project ReaCall</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jean-Jacques Dubray's (<a href="https://twitter.com/metapgmr">@metapgmr</a>), <a href="https://bitbucket.org/jdubray/reacall/src">Project ReaCall</a> combines <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React.js</a> and <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> to make it easier for API providers to develop and evolve API Client SDKs (ACS). This is definitely the direction I'd like to see client SDK and SPA deployment space go. I will have to play with ReaCall more, and I do not have any experience with React.js apps, but it looks pretty easy to bind your API endpoints to specific components in a React.js generated app.</p>
<p>Where this will get even more powerful, is when there are ready to go templates, and starter kits for developer to reverse engineer, and better understand how it works. I see that<a href="http://www.vimoctechnologies.com/">&nbsp;VIMOC Technologies' Landscape-Computing Architecture, and ambient computing API for city infrastructure employes ReaCall for their client deployment</a>. Some more examples, demonstrating common API uses, and real-world client deployments would go a long way in on-boarding people with the approach.</p>
<p><span>The API Evangelist network operates as almost 100 separate Jekyll driven sites / apps (some have more functionality than others), that run on Github Pages. I can easily envision other operators managing hundreds or thousands of sites, sub-sites, web, mobile, and devices based applications that are generated, maintained, and version-ed using the Project ReaCall approach.</span></p>
<p>I'd also like to play around with defining web, mobile, or device application stacks using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, bringing together many disparate APIs into a single collection, and use ReaCall to deploy the application--essentially using APIs.json as the index for where each of the Swagger definitions exist. Adding this to my to-do list, and we'll see if I can manage to float it to the top of my list this summer.</p>
