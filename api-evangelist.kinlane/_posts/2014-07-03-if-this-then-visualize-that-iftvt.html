<p>In the tech space, when we see a pattern that works, we run with it. This is why you hear, &ldquo;It is the Uber for X&rdquo;, or &ldquo;It is the Github for X&rdquo;, and I recently talked about how I&rsquo;m starting to see more of, &ldquo;<a title="It is the If This Then That (IFTT) for X" href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/16/its-if-this-then-that-for-x/">It is the If This Then That (IFTT) for X</a>&rdquo;. The IFTTT model, or what I call &ldquo;reciprocity&rdquo;, is an <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/02/10/bringing-etl-to-the-masses-with-apis/">evolution on the classic enterprise ETL model</a>, resulting in over 25 companies that I&rsquo;m tracking on in the space.</p>
<p>Reciprocity works, because it is about solving a simple problem for everyday users, using APIs to take a single action&mdash;if this happens over there, use APIs, to do that over there. There are many other words used to describe this evolution of ETL in the clouds, including interoperability, and automation, I use reciprocity because it better describes what is happening as part of the growing global API economy.</p>
<p>I recently went through all <a href="http://kinlane.com/projects/">65+ of my research projects</a>, one of them being <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/">reciprocity</a>, and as I was working on new research areas around open data, analysis, and visualization, I started thinking about how the IFTTT (reciprocity) model could be applied to analysis and visualization&mdash;resulting in a draft model I would call <strong><em>If This Then Visualize That (IFTVT)</em></strong>.</p>
<p>The IFTVT model provides the similar feedback loop as IFTTT, but instead of a resulting action, the end goal is a visualization.  If &ldquo;end of month&rdquo;, show me overview of Foursquare checkins. If &ldquo;Tweet receives 10 favorites&rdquo;, show me a list of Twitter users. If &ldquo;bank account goes below $50&rdquo;, show me last 25 charges. How you get your IFTVT visualizations would be up to you, maybe it is email, maybe SMS, maybe some sort of iGoogle like dashboard unit.</p>
<p>As with the IFTTT model, IFTVT gives us actionable, meaningful results from our increasingly disparate digital worlds. Using reciprocity, we are slowly being able to get a handle on the cloud versions of ourselves, and I think the next step could be analysis and resulting visualizations, in bit-size, meaningful, informative chunks via the channels that matter most to us.</p>
<p>Ok, get to work geeks! I&rsquo;ll tell the story, if you build it. ;-)</p>
