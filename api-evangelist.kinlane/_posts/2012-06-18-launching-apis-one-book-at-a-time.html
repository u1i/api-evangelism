<p><a href="http://developer.mimeo.com/blog/blog_detail.php?ID=103">Last May, Pearson Publishing began the roll-out of their new API platform</a>, by doing initial tests using their DK&rsquo;s Eyewitness Travel Guide material, before moving on to a wider range of subjects.  By the <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/08/16/re-inventing-pearson-publishing-using-apis/">end of the summer they had rolled out</a> a total of three APIs:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/eyewitness-guides/apimethod/entries-guide/189/overview" target="_blank">Eyewitness Guides</a></li>
<li><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/ft-press/apimethod/get-book-block/189/overview" target="_blank">FT Press</a></li>
<li><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/longman-dictionary/apimethod/get-entry-0/189/overview" target="_blank">Longman Dictionary</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A year later, they now have APIs for the <a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/pearson-kitchen-manager/apimethod/courses/190/overview" target="_blank">Pearson Kitchen Manager</a> and most recently the <a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/nursing-health-survival-guides-api/apimethod/get-article/189/overview" target="_blank">Nursing &amp; Health Survival Guides API</a>.</p>
<p>Pearson is obviously being very cautious with their precious business assets. Taking time to do it right when bundling up these resources and making available for developers via a RESTful interface.</p>
<p>The Pearson Developers community has many of the <a title="essential API building blocks" href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/03/07/api-area-common-building-blocks/">essential API building blocks</a> like documentation, blog, forum, and FAQ. <a title="Registration for Pearson APIs" href="http://developer.pearson.com/user">Registration for Pearson APIs</a> is self-service, allowing me to immediately verify my email, login and begin exploring the APIs.</p>
<p>For support, Pearson provides a contact form while also <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/pearsonapi">maintaing an active presence on Twitter</a>, and even provides a "report a bug" feature for each API. &nbsp;The terms of of use for Pearson APIs is pretty liberal, allowing to me use their content in my commercial applications, even if I use advertising.</p>
<p>Pearson has a done well in opening up their content with APIs.  They&rsquo;ve done it wisely, requiring registration so they can track how its used, but keeping registration self-service and providing sensible terms of use, so they are protected, but also giving developers enough freedom so they can get to building apps and innovating around their content.</p>
<p>It makes sense for Pearson to take it slowly and learn with each API implementation, making sure they do it right.  I think Pearson&rsquo;s simplistic approach to opening up their catalog is a great example for other publishers to follow.</p>
