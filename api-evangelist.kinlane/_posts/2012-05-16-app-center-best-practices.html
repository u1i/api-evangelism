<p>Last week Facebook <a title="announced a new App Center" href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2012/05/09/introducing-the-app-center/">announced a new App Center</a> where developers can submit applications they've built. &nbsp;Like any API owner, Facebook is looking for high quality applications to list in its directory and has published a list of App Center Best Practices:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Websites must provide a personalized experienc</strong>e - All websites and mobile web apps need to immediately present authenticated users with a logged-in experience. Specifically, we&rsquo;re looking for personalization, such as name and profile picture, so users know that their Facebook information is being used to create an account. </li>
<li><strong>Review your app settings </strong>- App detail pages are dynamic based on the integrations you&rsquo;ve specified on the basic settings page of the Developer App. Be sure to review this and remove any old or non-functional integrations. </li>
<li><strong>Provide high-quality images -</strong> Your images should match the quality of your app. As specified in the guidelines, images shouldn&rsquo;t have buttons, excessive text, borders, dropshadows, URLs, promotions, pricing, or third-party logos. </li>
<li><strong>Input accurate names &amp; thoughtful descriptions -</strong> Don&rsquo;t add any additional keywords to the name of your app. Proofread your app description for spelling and grammar and remove unnecessary symbols, like stars, hearts and multiple exclamation points.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some food for thought. Every app center will be different and have different requirements. I think I will add App Center Best Practices as a <a title="building block" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/buildingblocks/">building block</a>, after I look at a wide selection of other API app showcases, and identify some common best practices.</p>
