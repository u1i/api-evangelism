Part of it is my job, but part of it is me wanting to do things well. Master my approach to delivering APIs, using my well-rounded API toolbox. Reading the approach of other leading API providers, and honing my understanding of healthy, and not so healthy practices. I thoroughly enjoy studying what is going on and then applying it across what I do. However I am reminded regularly that most people are not interested in knowing, and doing things right--they just want things done.

As many of us discuss the finer details of API design, and the benefits of one approach over the other, other folks would rather us just point them to the solution that will work for them. They really don't care about the details, or mastering the approach, they just want it to work in their situation. Whether it is the individual, the project or organization they are working in, the environment is just not conducive to learning, understanding, and growth. They are just interested in services and tools that can deliver the desired solution for as cheap as possible--free, and open source whenever available.

You can see this reality playing out across the space. An example is OpenAPI (fka Swagger). It has largely been successful because of Swagger UI. Most people think OpenAPI is all about documentation, with their understanding reflecting the solution they delivered, not the full benefits brought to the table as part of the process of implementing the specification. This is just one example of how folks across the API space are interested in solutions, rather than the journey. This is why many API programs will stagnate and fail, because folks do them thinking they'll achieve some easier way of doing things, easy integrations, effortless innovation, or some other myth around API Valhalla.

I feel like much of this reality is set into motion through our education system. We don't always teach people to learn, we tend to teach them job skills that we (companies) perceive are relevant today. Technology training tends to become about software solutions, brands, and platforms, and rarely concepts. Then I feel like this is baked into company operations because of the escalated pace introduced by startup funding, all the way up to the constant quest for profits of publicly traded companies. An incentive model that encourages folks to just do, not necessary do right. Achieve short term goals, quarterly and annual metrics, and ignore the technical debt we created--that will be someone elses problem.

Helping developers learn about APIs feels like our healthcare system sometimes to me. Developers are focused on fixing problems, treating symptoms, and living with good enough outcomes. Nothing preventative. No healthy diet or exercise. Just solving the problems that are in front of us. Looking for solutions to these immediate needs. I need API documentation. I need some sort of automated testing, or security scanner. I just need that API to be performant. I'm not interested in learning about the web, standards, or other things that would help me in my work. I just want this to work, so I can move on to the next problem. It's a pretty big problem in the API space which I really don't have any solution for. I'll just keep learning, educating, and sharing with folks, but regularly reminding myself that not everyone will care about this stuff as much as I do, and that is just the way things are.
