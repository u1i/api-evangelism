<p>I am working hard to <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">establish a complete set of APIs for my own API stack</a> which includes establishing complete Swagger definitions for the 25 APIs that I personally operate. These Swagger definitions are then used to generate <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/04/07/including-postman-collections-in-my-apisjson-files/">Postman Collections</a>, <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/06/06/adding-apimatic-sdks-to-my-master-stack-and-including-in-each-apisjson/">APIMATIC SDKs</a>, and <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/06/06/adding-api-science-monitors-to-my-master-stack-and-including-in-each-apisjson/">API Science monitors</a>. I am also <a href="http://theapistack.com/">working hard to establish complete Swagger definitions for the 1000 companies in my API Stack</a>, something I am partnering with <a href="https://apimatic.io">APIMATIC</a> on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of this work, both teams are working hard to evolve our tooling for working with, and validating API definitions. I mentioned a couple weeks back, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/06/comparison-of-automatic-api-code-generation-tools-for-swagger/">when I shared client SDK research conducted by APIMATIC,</a> that quality SDK generation is kind of the high water mark for measuring API definition completion--meaning if your API definition isn't complete enough to generate a functional SDK, you need to spend more time in your API design editor, until it is more complete.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/15/my-minimum-viable-definition-for-a-complete-swagger-api-definition/">As I've been working to establish my own definition of what a complete Swagger definition is</a>, APIMATIC has been hard at work doing the same, but applying to&nbsp;WADL, Swagger, RAML, API Blueprint, IODocs, and Google Discovery. Also at the same time <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/09/my-new-api-for-asking-questions-of-apis--the-swagger-edition/">I'm building my questions API to help me automate the validation of Swagger definitions</a>, <a href="http://docs.apimatic.apiary.io/#reference/api-description-validation">APIMATIC has been working on their own validation API, which they just added to their existing API client code generation API</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://docs.apimatic.apiary.io">If you are generating machine readable API definitions in&nbsp;WADL, Swagger, RAML, API Blueprint, IODocs, or Google Discovery, then you should be validating your API designs using APIMATIC.</a> Once you know your API definitions are solid, then you should also generate all your SDKs with APIMATIC too--I am only about 20% the way through doing this for my API Stack.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nice work <a href="https://apimatic.io">APIMATIC</a> team. I predict by the end of the year we will have a full stack of APIs, and tooling, that helps us through almost every step of the API definition driven, API lifecycle.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>P.S. </strong>They just added Node.js and Go SDKs to their stack this week!</em></p>
<p><em><strong>P.S.S. </strong>APIMATIC is using Apiary.io.<br /></em></p>
