<p>The news is finally out.  I will be <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/06/24/new-round-innovators-joins-us-government-tackle-big-challenges">heading to Washington DC to spend a year as a White House Innovation Fellow</a>. APIs, open data and our government has been a passion of mine for my whole career, something that has escalated over the last year with my work on the White House Digital Strategy and Open Data Policy.</p>
<p>Now my passion for APIs+Government is being taken to a whole new level, and &nbsp;I will be heading to Washington DC, to<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows/round-2-fellows"> join 41 very talented individuals from the private sector</a>, to tackle some of the biggest challenges in our federal government.  I will be enjoying the full backing of the White House, to employ APIs to help stimulate innovation within government.</p>
<p>I will be specifically working on the Veterans Affiars</p>
<p>(VA) modernization team with two other very talented individuals, Mollie Ruskin (<a href="https://twitter.com/mollieruskin">@mollieruskin</a>) and Ben Willman (<a href="https://twitter.com/benwillman">@benwillman</a>).  We will be working on various projects, with the overall goal of streamlining the VA claims process.</p>
<p>When I received the call from the VA, asking me to come to Washington and help, I could not say no.  I'm pretty mission driven, when it comes to APIs, but helping out veterans and using APIs is the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ultimate</span> mission for me.</p>
<p>I have not one, but two dads who were Vietnam Veterans.  Both are passed on now, but I have personal experience seeing the VA process in operation.  I couldn't think of a more important mission for me to embark on, but to help streamline this process.</p>
<p>I will be keeping API Evangelist alive during my time in DC, but will not be taking on any new speaking engagements or projects. I will be dedicating myself 100% to my work at the VA.  However I would do the agency a disservice if I did not maintain my awareness of the overall API space.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who assisted in making this possible, and I look forward to this next step in my career.</p>
