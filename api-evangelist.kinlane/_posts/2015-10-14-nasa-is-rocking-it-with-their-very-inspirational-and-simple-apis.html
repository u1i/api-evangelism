<p>NASA just launched two new APIs, <a href="https://open.nasa.gov/">as part of their open data efforts</a>. I find the APIs they offer to be simple, and very inspirational examples of what an API can be. Maybe I just love space, but seeing these well designed, very fun APIs out of our countries space agency is just cool.</p>
<p>They added a <a href="https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#NeoWS">Near Earth Asteroids API</a>, and a <a href="https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#MarsPhotos">Mars Rover Photos API</a>, <a href="https://open.nasa.gov/blog/mars-photos-and-asteroids-are-just-get-request-away/">and they also understand the value of telling the story of the release on their blog</a>. Remember API providers, if you launch an API in the woods and don't blog about, nobody will know about it--storytelling is one of the most important tools in your toolbox.</p>
<p>Also, your APIs don't have to be complicated, and overthought. Just providing GET access to interesting images and other content like NASA is doing can really go a long ways in generating attention (it got me to write a blog post). You can see this in action with both their APIs, and their approach to their API portal--I look forward to seeing what APIs they release next!</p>
