<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/26/taking-another-look-at-the-department-of-labor-api-efforts/">I was taking another look at the API efforts out of the Department of Labor (DOL)</a>, to help refresh my awareness of what they are serving up, and I came across the <a href="http://developer.dol.gov/others/form">DOL Forms API</a>. The API does what it says, providing access on " the most frequently requested Department of Labor forms", which seems like to me should be the&nbsp;default for ALL government agencies.</p>
<p><span>The API returns some valuable details about each agency from including OMB number, URL, file extension, file size, and other meta information like a description, tags, and revision. I know that many in the API community would like all forms to be APIs, but I would be happy if we just started by making the concept of a forms API default across all government agencies first.</span></p>
<p><span>Before I dig into this individual API, I'm thinking that I will craft an OpenAPI Spec for the DOL Forms API, and see if there are any other form APIs available across US federal agencies that I should be considering. With a little work maybe I can merge them into a single open API definition that any government agency can follow, when thinking about which APIs they should be making available.</span></p>
