<p>As I&rsquo;m riding the build up for <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/index.php">APIStrat in Chicago</a>, and preparing for <a href="http://iloveapis2014.com/">I Love APIs in San Francisco</a>, and the <a href="http://www.apiacademy.co/api360/">API 360 Summit in DC</a>, I can&rsquo;t help but think about how busy the API event scene is getting&mdash;in 2014 there are 14 separate conferences focused on the world of APIs.</p>
<p>In the beginning there was just <a title="Gluecon" href="http://gluecon.com/">Gluecon</a>, <a href="http://www.defragcon.com/">Defrag</a>, and the <a href="http://www.apiconference.com/">Business of APIs</a>, then 3Scale and API Evangelist got together and started planning for @APIStrat, then immediately <a href="http://apidays.io/">API Days</a> happened, <a href="http://nordicapis.com/">Nordic APIs</a> came on the scene, <a href="http://api-craft.org/">API-Craft</a>a&nbsp; grew beyond just Meetup, and before you know we have 14 separate events.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be biased here, because @APIStrat is my baby, and I&rsquo;ve been involved in supporting API Days since day, so these two events will always have a special place in my heart. Even with this I believe in interoperability in the community and I am working to support all of the events equally, so if you are organizing make sure and reach out.</p>
<p>You can find me at I Love APIs in a couple weeks in San Francisco, as well as at API 360 in Washington DC the same week, and of course @APIStrat in Chicago at the end of September, and Nordic APIs in October. Unfortunately we messed up in planning @APIStrat, and made it at the same time as REST Fest, which seriously pissed me off&mdash;so I won&rsquo;t be attending REST Fest yet again this year. :-( This is part of the reason I'm putting together this research, so I don't make this mistake again.</p>
<p>As with the rest of my work, <a href="http://events.apievangelist.com/">I setup a Github repo, and website to give me a single place to aggregate information on API events</a>. I will do my best keep up to date, for my own education, but I am also looking to help you understand each of the events, the organizers, sponsors, speakers, and also who is attending. As I have time I will aso add a section for API Meetups, so we can keep tabs on the smaller API gatherings that are going on in various cities around the globe.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to participate in one of the conferences listed as a speaker or sponsor let me know, I&rsquo;ll hook you up with the organizer. If you&rsquo;d like to organize a meet up in your town, or you would like to bring in guest speakers from the outside API community, let me know as well&mdash;no guarantees, but I will see what I can do.</p>
<p>As with the rest of the space, I will do my best to keep my <a href="http://events.apievangelist.com/">API events research</a> up to date, and as with the rest of my research, feel free <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-events">fork and contribute</a> where you can&mdash;I need all the help I can get!</p>
