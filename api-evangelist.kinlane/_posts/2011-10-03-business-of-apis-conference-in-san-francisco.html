     That is a whole lot of API experience. I went to BAPI last year, and the talks were great and I connected with a bunch of other API experts, during the half-day event.
</p>
<p>
     BAPI is from 1:00 – 5:30 at the <a title="Julia Morgan Ballroom" href="http://www.juliamorganballroom.com/">Julia Morgan Ballroom</a> in San Francisco. The <a title="San Francisco BAPI" href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/1825463009?ref=ebtn">San Francisco BAPI</a> is the first of three events, with a <a title="New York event October 19th" href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/2025693905?ref=ebtn">New York event October 19th</a> and a <a title="London event October 25th" href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/2025746061?ref=ebtn">London event October 25th</a>.
