<p>I was learning about the <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-api-gateway-developer-portal">AWS Serverless Developer </a><a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-api-gateway-developer-portal">Portal</a>, and found their API plan layer to be an interesting evolution in how we define the access tiers of our APIs. There were a couple different layers of AWS's approach to deploying APIs that I found interesting, including the AWS marketplace integration, but I wanted to stop for a moment and focus in on their API plan approach.</p>
<p>Using the AWS API Gateway you can establish a variety of API plans, with the underlying mechanics of that plan configurable via the AWS API Gateway user interface or the AWS API Gateway API. In the documentation for the&nbsp;AWS Serverless Developer&nbsp;Portal, they include a JSON snippet of the configuration of the plan for each API being deployed.</p>
<p>This reminds me that I needed to take another look at <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">my API plan research</a>, and take the plan configuration, rate limit, and other&nbsp;service composition API definitions I have, and aggregate their schema into a single snapshot. <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/2016/02/13/my-tooling-and-api-for-gathering-and-organizing-the-details-of-the-plans-and-pricing-for-apis/">It has been a while since I worked on my machine-readable API plan definition</a>, and there are now enough API management solutions with an API layer out there, I should be able to pull a wider sampling of the&nbsp;schema in play. I'm not in the business of defining what the definition should be, I am only looking to aggregate what others are doing.</p>
<p>I am happy to see more folks sharing machine-readable <a href="http://openapis.org">OpenAPI</a> definitions describing the surface area of their APIs. As this work continues to grow we are going to have to also start sharing machine-readable definitions of the monetization, plan, and access layers of our API operations. After I identify the schema in play for some of the major <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">API management</a> providers I track on, I'm going to invest more work into my standard API plan definition to make the access levels of <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs more discoverable using APIs.json</a>.</p>
