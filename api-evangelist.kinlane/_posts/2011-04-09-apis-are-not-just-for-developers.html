The main reason they are getting easier to use is due to the adoption of RESTful approaches when delivering APIs.<p></p>
Many APIs that use REST can be easily hacked by just changing values in the URL query string, instantly making APIs accessible by a wider audience<p></p>
Once users get past the confusing acronyms and jargon us programmers use, and realize whats going on, they can start accessing the data and functionality that's behind the curtain.<p></p>
RESTful APIs open up data and functionality to anyone, and we are starting to see a new breed of hackers from many disciplines including journalism, social media marketing, and government, to name a few.<p></p>
As technology becomes increasingly important in our every day lives, people can't wait for IT or programmers to deliver, savvy users start hacking on their own.<p></p>
A very innovative example of this I saw lately was by Social Media Strategist, <a title="Tom Critchlow" href="http://www.seomoz.org/users/profile/30546">Tom Critchlow</a>.  Tom wrote a great post called, <a title="Using Tools &amp; APIs to Track Your Social Media Strategy" href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/how-to-track-your-social-media-strategy">Using Tools &amp; APIs To Track Your Social Media Strategy.</a>

Through a need to understand the impact of his social media efforts, he learned that he can query top social sites using their API to quantify the impact of his site(s).<p></p>
Then using Google Docs, along with with the power of <a title="Google App Scripts" href="http://code.google.com/googleapps/appsscript/">Google App Scripts</a> he pulls counts for shares, likes, etc for his site using Social Media APIs.<p></p>
Using RESTful Social Media APIs, and Google Docs, he is able to hack these APIs, get the data he is looking for, store it in a spreadsheet, and then visualize it.<p></p>
His efforts truly represent the power of APIs, and how important it is that we deliver simple, RESTful interfaces that developers and non-developers can use in our every day business.
