<p>I am impressed with the work that the Open API Initiative (OAI) working group has accomplished with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.openapis.org/specification/v3insights">version 3.0 release of the OpenAPI Specification</a>. I have had zero involvement in moving the specification forward (something I'm changing), and after coming back to the effort I am impressed with what they've prioritized, and accomplished for this release.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The highlights in version 3.0 of the OpenAPI Spec for me are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Components</strong> - The new components architecture&nbsp;really reflects "APIs" in my opinion, making things modular and reusable.</li>
<li><strong>Body</strong> - Catching up when it comes to allowing the body to be defined separately from the headers&nbsp;and parameters.</li>
<li><strong>Content Negotiation </strong>- You can now define content objects to define the&nbsp;<span>relationship between response objects, media types, and schema.</span></li>
<li><strong>Linking</strong> - It isn't hypermedia, but it is definitely a nod towards hypermedia, allowing the linking of objects.</li>
<li><strong>Webhooks</strong> - You can now define callbacks that can be attached to a subscription operation describing an outbound operation.</li>
<li><strong>Schema</strong> - Increased investment in JSON Schema, including support of `oneOf`, `anyOf` and `not` support, as well allowing for alternative&nbsp;schema now.</li>
<li><strong>Hosts</strong> - You can now have multiple hosts, allowing you to more narrowly define the host for each path.</li>
<li><strong>Examples</strong> - Allows you to better describe, and provide examples of APIs responses and requests.</li>
<li><strong>Version Identifier</strong> - Not a big one, but removing the swagger: "2.0" identifier--it will now just be&nbsp;openapi.</li>
<li><strong>Cookies</strong> - I'm not a big fan of this being introduced, but it makes sense, and I'm sure is usable for many API operators.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.openapis.org/specification/v3insights">The OAI blog provides a five-part series covering the version 3.0 release</a>. These ten areas are the highlights for me. I think they nailed it as far as what was needed, while also pushing into areas like linking and webhooks that I hadn't anticipated. I am looking forward to playing with converting some of my 2.0 specs to be 3.0 compliant--once I am a little more intimate with it, I can do better to estimate how long it will take for me to evolve my platform from 2.0 to 3.0.</p>
<p>I am impressed with what the OpenAPI Spec working group has gotten accomplished. I am optimistic about what is possible with OpenAPI Spec in 2017--something I'm going to be investing in heavily.</p>
