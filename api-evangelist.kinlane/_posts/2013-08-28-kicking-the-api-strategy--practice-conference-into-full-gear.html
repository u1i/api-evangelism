<p><a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2013SF/index.php" target="_blank">While we officially launched </a><a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2013SF/index.php" target="_blank">API Strategy &amp; Practice, San Francisco edition</a> back in May, we've been pretty quiet during the summer months. Well, now summer is coming to a close, and we are now less than 60 days away from the API community conversation that is #APIStrat.</p>
<p>To start ramping things up, I'm going to start showcasing the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2013SF/speakers.php">amazing line-up of speakers</a> we have for the event, and giving the <a title="kick-ass sponsors" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2013SF/sponsors.php">kick-ass sponsors</a> who have stepped up to support the event, the "love" they deserve.</p>
<p>Early bird pricing has ended, but you have less than a month to get in on the mid range pricing. Don't miss out like so many did in February when #APIStrat New York City sold out--<a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2013SF/register.php">buy your tickets</a> now.</p>
<p>Even with large number of speakers we have lined up, we still have some slots left open, and will be making some announcements of other big names to the lineup-so stay tuned.</p>
<p>I will be exploring the wide range of topics and tracks we have planned here on API Evangelist as well as the <a title="APIStrat Blog" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2013SF/blog.php">#APIStrat blog</a>, so subscribe to our RSS feeds and tune in on Twitter for more details.</p>
