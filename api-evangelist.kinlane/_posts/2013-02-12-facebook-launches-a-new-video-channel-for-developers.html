<p><a title="Facebook launched a new video channel" href="http://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2013/02/06/a-new-video-channel-for-developers--facebook-developers-live/">Facebook launched a new video channel</a> last week, dedicated to keeping developers up to date on the latest news, tutorials, speaking sessions from the Facebook developer ecosystem.</p>
<p>Facebook is going to provide content for web and mobile developers, with attention in other specialty areas like gaming and information for publishers.</p>
<p>The first edition of the channel will be recorded live on February 19th, with Director of Product Doug Purdy, with the top 3 things every mobile developer needs to know.</p>
<p>I'm adding a video channel to my list of <a title="API building blocks" href="/buildingblocks/">API building blocks</a>.  I don't think you have to be a Facebook before you have your own channel.  Using Google Hangouts + Youtube is an easy way for any API owner to start their own video channel to support developers.</p>
