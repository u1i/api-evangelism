<p><a title="Image Popper" href="http://www.shapeways.com/creator/image_popper">Image Popper</a> is a new tool that allows you to upload a black and white JPG, and Shapeways will generate 3D model from it.</p>
<p>After the image is uploaded you can choose the size and how much you want the drawing raised to create the 3D object.</p>
<p>Innovative tools like Image Popper that allow users to build 3D models for 3D printing without CAD experience is an important piece of moving forward the <a title="3D printing and manufacturing" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/04/3d-printing-and-manufacturing-with-google/">3D printing and manufacturing</a> industry.</p>
