Everyone is talking about the<a title="growth in mobile payments in 2011" href="http://gigaom.com/2011/06/24/3b-in-mobile-payments-for-paypal-this-year-but-bigger-prize-at-stake/">growth in mobile payments this year</a>.
<p></p>Forrester Research predicted that mobile commerce will hit $6 billion in 2011 - and reach up to $31 billion by 2016.
<p></p><a title="Paypal Mobile Payments" href="https://personal.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/?cmd=_render-content&amp;content_ID=marketing_us/mobile_payments">PayPal</a> just raised their 2011 Mobile Total Payments Volume (TPV) projections to $3 billion. Paypal first predicted $1.5 billion in 2011 mobile payments volume, then in February, they upped that to $2 billion, and now they've adjusted to $3 billion.
<p></p>Paypal is running $10 million in mobile TPV a day, up from the $6 million they reported in March.
<p></p>It shows that mobile users are actively purchasing products and services online using sites and applications on their mobile devices.
<p></p>Just like with social media and cloud computing, APIs are a silent force behind the mobile revolution. APIs drive the applications and sites that mobile users are puting to use.
<p></p>The growth in mobile payments is a sign of the overall growth in the mobile market, as well as massive growth in API deployment to support the mobile demand.
