<p>I read a great post recently about how a company called <a href="http://www.engineering.com/3DPrinting/3DPrintingArticles/ArticleID/4979/Start-Up-Offers-Blueprints-For-3D-Printed-Parts.aspx">Teenage Engineering has started providing 3D CAD files that allow their customers to 3D print replacement parts</a> for the products they make.</p>
<p>It is awesome to see things I talk about become reality. &nbsp;I wrote about the concept of a <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/08/01/my-3d-printed-junk-drawer/">3D printed junk drawer</a> last year, while doing research on 3D printing and APIs.</p>
<p>Teenage Engineering is taking a big step, and potentially leading the industry in new ways. &nbsp;Can you imagine if companies by default, provide 3D drawings of common replacement parts and pieces for their products?</p>
<p>There is still a lot of gaps in how all of this can work, 3D printing is widely available yet, but with retailers like <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/news/staples-3d-print-mcor-iris,19447.html">Staples playing around with offering 3D printing on demand</a>, the future for 3D printing is looking pretty bright.</p>
