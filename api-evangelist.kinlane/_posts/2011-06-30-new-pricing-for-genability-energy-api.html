<a title="Energy pricing data provider Genability" href="http://www.genability.com/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/genability/genability-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a><a title="Energy pricing data provider Genability" href="http://www.genability.com/">Energy pricing data provider Genability</a> just announced the roll-out of more <a title="flexible pricing for their API" href="https://developer.genability.com/plans-pricing">flexible pricing for their API</a>.
<p></p>The new pricing structure gives Genability API developers more options with no long term commitments, when accessing the Genability tariff and electricity pricing database.
<p></p><a title="Genability API" href="https://developer.genability.com/">Genability API</a> pricing starts with a free plan which offers 10 unique tariff credits per month, and will serve up 1,000 calls per hour.
<p></p>Genability bulk paid plans range from $89.99 / month to $1499.99 a month:<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/genability/genability-pricing.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Bronze for 89.99 / month</strong>, with 100 unique tariff credits per month, and 5,000 calls per hour
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Silver for 299.99 / month</strong>, with 350 unique tariff credits per month, and 20,000 calls per hour
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Gold for $799.99 / month</strong>, with 1000 unique tariff credits per month, and 50,000 calls per hour
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Platinum for $1499.99 / month</strong>, with 2000 unique tariff credits per month, and 100,000 calls per hour
     </li>
</ul>The call per hour portion is pretty straightforward, but whats a tariff credit?
<p></p>A tariff credit is when you request a full tariff (including all its rates, bands and properties), or request a price, or a calculation on a tariff. Genability keep track of each tariff you request, and keep a count of the unique ones, with subsequent calls for previously requested tariffs being free.
<p></p>All of Genability's API plans both, both free and paid, include LSE data, season &amp; time of use data, and zip codes, and geo-location data.
<p></p>Genability also offers custom pricing plans, if one of their doesn't fit your needs, just contact them and they'll negotiate additional services, flexible usage policies or volume pricing.
<p></p>It's interesting to see pricing for an API that provides access to energy utility pricing, take on a very utility pricing model for consumption.
