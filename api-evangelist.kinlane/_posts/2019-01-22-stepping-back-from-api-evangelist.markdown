<p><img src="{{ page.image }}" width="25%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>After eight years of storytelling I have decided to step back from API Evangelist. There just aren't enough nutrients in the work to sustain me financially, ethically, or creatively. It has been a fun and interesting ride since I kicked off this crazy idea in 2010, but the time has come to step away.

While I still have some long form essays I'd like to publish after gathering my thoughts, and I will keep the blog and Twitter account up for historical purposes, I'm stepping away to give 100% of my attention to a full time job. Who knows, maybe someday I'll come back around to the work, but for now I'm going to put it all down.

Thank you to everyone along the way who has supported me. I wish you all the best, and look forward to seeing some of your faces down the road. I am thankful for all the wonderful memories we've created along the way as we all worked to make APIs a little more human.

Onward, the API Evangelist.
