<p>I spend a lot of time looking for a quick description or logo for companies. &nbsp;Finding a good quality logo is a pain in the ass!</p>
<p>To be the change I want to see in the world, I created an <a title="about.json" href="/about.json">about.json file for API Evangelist</a>.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/4003224.js?file=about.json"></script>
<p>Now you can programmatically pull information about API Evangelist, and I will keep updated as things change.</p>
