<p>If you were at <a href="https://twitter.com/defrag">@defrag</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/apistrat">@apistrat</a> in November, you know that <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/29/the-api-lifecycle-my-talk-from-defrag-and-apistrat/">I am working to better understand the often complex world of APIs using the Subway map concept</a>. My goal is to better understand the overall API life cycle, as well as the life cycle of individual APIs, and how I can articulate, strategize, and execute on it all, using a subway experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://restlet.com/http-status-codes-map">It made me happy to see the folks over at Restlet playing with the same concept</a>&nbsp;(we didn't coordinate on it honestly), to help articulate HTTP status codes, which is a very important topic for the space, and we need more education tools, and stories around it. Using the subway map analogy, Restlet provides a representation of the five areas of status codes, providing a simple way to explore them, and find a description of each individual status code.</p>

<p>The subway map they provide is currently a static map, but this is one of the biggest potential areas in using this analogy for me, is that with the right JavaScript + JSON voodoo, you can make it real-time, and interactive. This is something I'm working on to bring the entire lifecycle to the forefront this month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nice work Restlet team, I enjoy these efforts by providers to help educate the space, especially when they do it in creative and fun ways like this.</p>
