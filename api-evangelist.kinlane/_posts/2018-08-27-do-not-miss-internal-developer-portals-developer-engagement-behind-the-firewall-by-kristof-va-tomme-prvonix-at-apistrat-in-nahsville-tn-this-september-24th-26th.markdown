<p><img src="{{ page.image }}" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>We are getting closer to [the 9th edition of APIStrat happening in Nashville, TN this September 24th through 26th](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/). [The schedule for the conference is up](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/program/schedule/), along with [the first lineup of keynote speakers](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/program/keynote_speakers/), and my drumbeat of stories about the event continues here on the blog. Next up in our session lineup is _"Do Not Miss Internal Developer Portals: Developer Engagement Behind the Firewall"_ by Kristof Van Tomme (@kvantomme), Pronovix (@pronovix) on September 25th.

Here is Kristof's abstract for the API session:

_While there are a lot of talks and blogposts about APIs and the importance of an APIs Developer eXperience, most are about public API products. And while a lot of the best practices for API products are also applicable to private APIs, there are significant differences in the circumstances and trade-offs they need to make.
The most important difference is probably in their budgets: as potential profit centers, API products can afford to invest a lot more money in documentation and UX driven developer portal improvements. Internal APIs rarely have that luxury._

_In this talk I will explain the differences between public and private APIs, introduce upstream DX, and explain how it can improve downstream DX. Introduce experience design (a.k.a. gamification) and Innersourcing (open sourcing practices behind the firewall) and describe how they could be used on internal developer portals._

Kristof is an expert in delivering developer portals and API documentation, making his talk a must attend session. [You can register for the event here](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/attend/register/), and there [are still sponsorship opportunities available](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/sponsor/). Don't miss out on APIStrat this year--it is going to be a good time in Nashville as we continue the conversation we started back in 2012 with the initial edition of the API industry event in New York City.

I am looking forward to seeing you all in Nashville next month!
