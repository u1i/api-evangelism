<p>The <a href="https://www.dwolla.com/developers">Dwolla API</a> sent out an email to developers today, letting us know that, "Effective January 21, 2014, all timestamps returned by REST API endpoints will be in UTC format.&rdquo;  Dwolla is looking to fix the issue of ambiguous timestamps, where the time zone is&nbsp;variable and not indicated in the timestamp.</p>
<p>Currently the timestamps look like: <em>9/20/2013 12:45:07 AM</em></p>
<p>After the switch to UTC they will look like: <em>2010-11-12T13:14:15Z</em></p>
<p>Formatted according to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601 standard</a>. This is a much cleaner, internationalized approach. I&rsquo;ve seen this mistake a lot, and still do it myself on some new systems. As an self-centered american, we tend to think the world evolves around us, and we don&rsquo;t think about these scaling issues ahead of time.</p>
<p>Are your API data formats in UTC? No? Maybe it is something you want to change before you grow too big and get too many developers on your API.</p>
