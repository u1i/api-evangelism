<p>Google is stepping back and rethinking how they interact and support their developer community and are <a title="looking for feedback" href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/09/what-does-it-mean-to-be-google.html">looking for feedback</a> from the developer community.</p>
<p>They want to know what inspires you as a developer, what does being a Google developer mean to you, and how Google can make your experience as a developer better.</p>
