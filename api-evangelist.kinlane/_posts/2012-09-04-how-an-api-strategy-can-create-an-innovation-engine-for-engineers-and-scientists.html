<p><em>This is a case study sent to me from National Instruments. &nbsp;I just had to post it as is, because it just shows the serious potential of APIs. &nbsp;If cloud computing and mobile hasn't convinced you that APIs are here to stay, take a look at what National Instruments is doing.</em></p>
<p>Over the past five years, <a title="National Instruments" href="http://www.ni.com/">National Instruments</a> (NI) has been using an API strategy to enable a developer ecosystem, based on their <a title="LabView" href="http://www.ni.com/labview/">LabVIEW software platform</a>. &nbsp;NI equips engineers and scientists with tools that accelerate productivity, innovation, and discovery &ndash; and a strong ecosystem is core to their philosophy. &nbsp;This case study takes a look at one approach, and the business role that APIs play in expanding into new markets. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />As background, NI LabVIEW is a productivity tool and graphical programming language used in all kinds of scientific applications. &nbsp;The breadth of users range from &ldquo;aspiring engineers&rdquo; who use a specialized version to program the Lego Mindstorms NXT software, to some of the world&rsquo;s top researchers who use LabVIEW to design complex systems including software for the CERN hadron collider and the SpaceX control center. &nbsp;</p>

<p>To understand why an API strategy was needed, first consider the standard use-case for LabVIEW. &nbsp;Most companies use LabVIEW as a productivity tool/IDE to develop applications using the default software stack provided by NI, and combining that software with measurement hardware. &nbsp;&nbsp;A common application is production testing of a consumer device, such as the <a href="http://sine.ni.com/cs/app/doc/p/id/cs-662">Xbox 360 controller from Microsoft</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;LabVIEW allows complete customization of an engineering application, just as is possible with any other programming language. &nbsp;The difference between a text-based language, and LabVIEW&rsquo;s graphical approach, that that the graphical approach is familiar to engineers who grow up drawing block diagrams of systems, and it makes connecting to real-world I/O very efficient. &nbsp;&nbsp;LabVIEW also supports parallelism (multithreading), memory management, built-in analysis, control algorithms, and measurement routines which helps engineering firms build sophisticated applications more quickly. <br /><br />NI&rsquo;s core business model is to serve end-users directly, but the ability to scale through an open platform allows &ldquo;repeatability&rdquo;. &nbsp;In otherwords, through an API strategy, Company A in one specialized domain, can extend the NI platform or build a vertical product on top of it, such that Company B can leverage that. &nbsp;The software stack for 3rd party developers looks very similar to the stack for end-users, with the addition of APIs that enable product development. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In recent years, there have been some very compelling use-cases that have arisen from the LabVIEW ecosystem, and over 100 certified products in total. &nbsp;Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of three examples:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Robotics</strong> - ImagingLab GmbH, is a German company that has created LabVIEW toolkits to allow engineers to control industrial robots from leading manufacturers including DENSO, KUKA, Epson, Yaskawa, Mitsubishi, and more. &nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Big Data</strong> - Neural ID, a venture backed firm in the San Francisco bay area, has created a pattern recognition engine called CURE, to analyze unstructured data. &nbsp;This product sits on top of LabVIEW, and can recognize any kind of waveform and provide analytic capabilities to allow organizations to make better decisions about their data. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s used by companies like ecoATM and NASA. &nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Cloud Computing </strong>- Maintainable Software has developed a software-as-a-service product for use in electronics manufacturing test, for cloud-based data management.&nbsp;&nbsp; Their software is used by customers such as Coulomb Technologies, a leader in electric vehicle chargers.&nbsp; In addition, &nbsp;Maintainable Software has deep expertise in tools used to develop cloud infrastructure, and have published a technical book on the subject.&nbsp; Their product works on the latest tablet devices such as Apple iPads.</li>
</ul>
<ol> </ol>
<p>The companies listed above offer their respective products through NI&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.ni.com/labviewtools/">LabVIEW Tools Network</a>, which is an appstore dedicated to engineers and scientists. <br /><br />In summary, an API strategy can enable 3rd party developers and tech companies to innovate on a mature software platform and expand it into new markets. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s an approach that&rsquo;s not just limited to companies in the mobile or web space&ndash; it is equally as powerful in the B2B space in industries like test &amp; measurement, and embedded control. &nbsp;&nbsp;For a product like LabVIEW with a 25+ year history, an API strategy is one of the best ways to compliment in-house R&amp;D efforts with an ecosystem approach, and drive innovation in emerging areas like Robotics, Big Data, and Cloud.</p>
