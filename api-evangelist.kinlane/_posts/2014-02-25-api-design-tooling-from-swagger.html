<p>As part of my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/16/api-design-do-you-swagger-blueprint-or-raml/">research in the world of API design</a>, I&rsquo;m looking into the different approaches by API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger, to provide API definitions, services and tools that assist developers in better designing APIs.  I have already look at the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/22/the-evolving-motivations-behind-api-definitions/">evolving motivations behind API definitions</a>, and some insight into the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/31/the-vision-behind-swagger-api-blueprint-and-raml/">vision behind Swagger, API Blueprint and RAML</a>, next up is take a look at the tooling that is evolving around each approach.</p>
<p>First up is <a href="https://helloreverb.com/developers/swagger" target="_blank">Swagger</a>, from the folks over at <a href="https://www.wordnik.com/" target="_blank">Wordnik</a>. I would consider Swagger the first mover in this new world of API design, with the Wordnik team&rsquo;s approach centered around a JSON based API definition:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Swagger Core" href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core">Swagger Core</a></strong> - A JSON based API definition format, which allows for the description of  REST APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>Around the Swagger core the Wordnik team developed a core set of tooling that met their immediate needs for the Wordnik API:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Swagger CodeGen" href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-codegen">Swagger CodeGen</a></strong> - A template-driven engine to generate client code in different languages by parsing a Swagger Core definition</li>
<li><strong><a title="Swagger UI" href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-ui">Swagger UI</a></strong> - A dependency-free collection of HTML, Javascript, and CSS assets that dynamically generate beautiful documentation from a Swagger defined API</li>
</ul>
<p>Secondarily other more specific tools have emerged:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Swagger JS" href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-js">Swagger JS</a></strong> - Javascript library to connect to swagger-enabled APIs via browser or nodejs</li>
<li><strong><a title="Swagger Node Express" href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-node-express">Swagger Node Express</a></strong> - Swagger module for node.js w/express module</li>
<li><strong><a title="Swagger Socket" href="https://github.com/wordnik/swaggersocket">Swagger Socket</a></strong> - A REST over WebSocket</li>
<li><strong><a title="Swagger Play 2" href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core/tree/master/modules/swagger-play2">Swagger Play 2</a></strong> - Provides automatically-generated Swagger JSON for the Play! framework</li>
</ul>
<p>Swagger was born out of Wordnik&rsquo;s desire for interactive documentation, but evolved into tooling for generating server and client side code, and has ended up providing a central language for facilitating discussions around API design, deployment and integration in many other areas.</p>
<p>I know there are some other tools available out there for Swagger, this just represents would I could find easily off their Github account. If there are other Swagger tools you know of, let me know and I&rsquo;m happy to add to this post and my research.</p>
