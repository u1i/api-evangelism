<p>I'm working on a series of simple scripts that help people deploy APIs from some of the most common data sources. I'm starting with a series of PHP scripts, and first up is MySQL to API.</p>
<p>For this PHP implementation, I'm using the <a href="http://www.slimframework.com/">SLIM framework</a>, which provides a dead simple REST framework you can use to deploy an API from a variety of data sources.   To begin deploying an API from your MySQL database, download the REST library and upload to your server that runs PHP.</p>
<p>Slim is pretty straightforward to work with, to add each API endpoint you just add a single PHP file under methods. For this how-to guide we are going to add a simple endpoint from our products database.</p>

<p>Next you just add an include reference in the index page for your slim implementation:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/7094951.js"></script>
<p>This API just uses ID, Name, Price and Description of the product, and queries by a simple query parameter. You can use this as a template for your own product database, adding and removing fields as you need, or completely retrofitting for any database table.  That is it, now you have a simple product API that pulls a list of products from a MySQL database.</p>
