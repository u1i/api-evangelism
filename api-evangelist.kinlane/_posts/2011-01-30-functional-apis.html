APIs are not just for exchanging of <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/data-20/">data</a>. They provide much needed functionality for developers and integrators.

The functionality of an API can provide shipping costs as the <a href="http://fedex.com/us/developer/" target="_blank">Fedex API</a> does, or provide you with directions from San Francisco, CA to New York, NY as with the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/index.html" target="_blank">Google Maps API</a>.<p></p>
Functional APIs can, as the name suggests, provide much needed functionality to users that might be very costly or impossible for them to implement on their own.<p></p>
If a developer wants to provide the location of a <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/mobile/">mobile</a> <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/application/">application</a> user, they need to be able to turn the latitude and longitude of the users position into a physical address, city, state and zip code. This would require creating a massive look-up table of latitude, longitude, and addresses. This wouldn't be impossible, but it would be very costly.<p></p>
Functional APIs can save developers time when building their applications by providing needed functionality immediately, cost effectively, and with functionality that would otherwise be impossible without an API.
