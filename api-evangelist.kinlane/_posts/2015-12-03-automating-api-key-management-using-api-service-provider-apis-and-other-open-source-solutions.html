<p>I'm working my way through some of the low hanging fruit in my API notebook, when it comes to stories, and found a story thread I was working on regarding automating API key management. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/14/storing-api-keys-in-the-private-master-github-repository-for-use-in-github-pages/">I'm personally storing my keys, across the private master branch for my API reps, because I don't have any super-sensitive data, and it helps me manage across hundreds of APIs, in a central way</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/16/with-number-of-apis-continuing-to-grow-account-automation-will-be-key/">I've talked about the need to automate API key management in the past</a>--with the number of APIs we are using, to reach the level of security we will need, the lower level of keys will need a global refresh and management process. This level of keys most likely won't ever result in large scale security breaches, but will cause plenty headaches for both API providers and consumers.</p>
<p>If you use one of the following API management solutions, they provide you with an API for managing your API keys:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://support.3scale.net/reference/active-docs"><strong>3Scale</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://apigee.com/docs/management/apis"><strong>Apigee</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="https://tyk.io/v1.8/rest-api/api-key-management/"><strong>Tyk</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>This will help you manage your keys, if you are an API provider, but doesn't do a lot for you to manage your API keys across providers, as an API consumer. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/">Amazon provides a key management solution</a>, but at first glance it appears to be something you can use to manage keys across your AWS infrastructure (am I wrong?)--which makes sense for supporting AWS objectives. ;-)</p>
<p>When I wrote my last post on the growing need for API key management solutions, I received a number of email and DMs, which yielded two pretty interesting open source key management solutions, <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/vault">Vault</a> and <a href="https://github.com/square/keywhiz">Keywhiz</a>. I'm going to evaluate these solutions for their viability as a back-end for an API driven, API key management solution, but I have a lot more work to do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm also working with a partner of mine, <a href="https://securedb.co/">SecureDB, and consider the possibility fo developing an encrypted API key management solution</a>, which then would be accessible via their secure API. They are looking for some interesting solutions like this to be developed on their platform, so if you are a developer, and looking for a viable micro startup idea--let me know.</p>
<p>As with everything in my world, the concept of automating API keys using APIs, and managing of keys across API platforms, is a work in progress--stay tuned!</p>
