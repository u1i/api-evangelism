<p><a href="https://octopart.com">Octopart is a search engine for electronic parts</a>. They have been on my API monitoring radar for some time now, because they have a <a href="https://octopart.com/api/home">very well done API</a>. Octopart was one of the first API providers I wrote about, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/07/31/giving-excel-power-users-the-api-driven-resources-they-need/">who were making their data available via their API, available in spreadsheets for business users, via a plugin</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reasons I am writing about Octopart this time, is much more mundane. They are just doing it right, and I wish all product websites, had an API presence like Octopart does. As soon as you land on the home page of the site, where you can search for electronics products, all you have to do is scroll down, and you immediately see a link for the API. There is also a prominent set of links in the footer, labeled products, that focus on the API, as well as the Excel and Google spreadsheet connectors built on top of it.</p>
<p>Octopart has a well designed API, that clearly plays a significant role in their overall existence as an online electronic parts company. Every time I read one of their blog post, or end up in their developer area looking at something, I can't help but think about how ALL product companies should be following Octopart's lead. It all takes me back to the year 2000, where I was working hard to convince companies of the importance of having a website, as I now work to convince companies of the importance of having an API. #dejavu</p>
