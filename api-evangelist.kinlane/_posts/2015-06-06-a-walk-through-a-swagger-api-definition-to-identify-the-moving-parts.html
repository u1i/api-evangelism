<p>I recently added a new tool to my hacker storytelling toolbox, that allows me to easily assemble walk through, that help me guide my readers through a scripted series of steps around any of my research areas. <a href="http://api-portal.apievangelist.com/">I first did it to walk through what I'd consider to be my minimum viable developer portal</a>, and now I decided to <a href="http://swagger.apievangelist.com/">apply to my Swagger research</a>.</p>
<p>I am working on a set of APIs that help me quantify whether a Swagger definition is "complete" or not, to help me tackle my goals around <a href="http://theapistack.com/">my API Stack research</a>, and establish a rich set of complete, open API definitions that the community can put to use. What better way to quantify all the moving parts of Swagger, than to actually create a 101 walk through of its moving parts.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://swagger.apievangelist.com/walk-through.html">I added the Swagger walk through to my Swagger research</a>, and will keep refining, and adding more information to it. I've managed to further evolve my definition of what constitutes a complete Swagger definition, allowing me to work towards a somewhat automated, API driven service that will help me understand how complete each Swagger definition in my API stack is, and where the work is that needs to be done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal here is to get <a href="http://theapistack.com/companies.html">all the APIs for 900+ companies in my API Stack fully defined using APIs.json and Swagger</a>, while also establishing a pretty robust set of tools and services for certifying Swagger definitions. If you want to get involved, there is a lot of work to be done, just visit the API Stack, and get involved via the Github repo.</p>
