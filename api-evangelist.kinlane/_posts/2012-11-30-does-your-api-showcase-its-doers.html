<p>Poster boy for how to properly run your API ecosystem properly, <a title="Twilio" href="http://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>, recently updated their <a href="http://www.twilio.com/doers">DOer Gallery</a> to highlight developers in the Twilio ecosystem that build cool stuff on the popular voice and SMS API.</p>
<p>Twilio has the best record I&rsquo;ve seen of any API, when it comes to showcasing and being loved by their developer community, and I'm sure the DOer Gallery plays an important role in that.</p>

<p>The Twilio DOer Gallery has the following features:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Personal Details</li>
<li>Short Bio</li>
<li>Skills</li>
<li>Other Profiles</li>
<li>Projects</li>
</ul>
<p>Devloper Galleries like Twilios might not be for every API platform.  But if you have a passionate base of developers you might want to consider giving them their own profile and a gallery where they can not just discover and interact with each other, it can let other companies find potential developers to execute projects via your API.</p>
<p>A Developer Gallery can be a great way to give your API developers some love and attention.  Twilio even features developers from their DOer Gallery on their blog in a "DOer of the Month".</p>
<p>Would showcasing your &ldquo;API DOers&rdquo; benefit your API community?</p>
