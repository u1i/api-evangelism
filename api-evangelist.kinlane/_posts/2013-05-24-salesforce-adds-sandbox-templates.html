<p><a href="http://www.salesforce.com/">Salesforce</a> is doing some pretty <a href="http://blogs.developerforce.com/tech-pubs/2013/05/sandbox-templates-and-a-new-look.html">interesting stuff with the sandbox environment</a> for <a href="http://developer.force.com/">DeveloperForce</a>.</p>
<p>Using the DeveloperForce sandbox you can create copies of your data, allowing you to develop, test or train against, not just a sandbox, but a relevant and meaningful copy of your company's data.</p>
<p>The Force.com sandbox has always allowed you to create a separate copy of your data, but now they let you create sandbox templates, allowing you to create specific data sets that you can reuse in different ways.</p>
<p>Seeing this feature coming out of Salesforce has prompted me to take a closer look at their approach to the DeveloperForce sandbox environment.  I'm sure there are other features and approaches to sandboxing we can learn from the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-salesforce-com/">API pioneer</a>.</p>

<p>This reminds me of the story I wrote about UC Berkeley's desire for <a href="/2013/03/13/an-api-that-scrubs-personally-identifiable-information-from-other-apis/">An API That Scrubs Personally Identifiable Information From Other APIs</a>.</p>
<p>As the API universe expands, I'm seeing a greater need for me to study and tell stories around API testing, monitoring, sandboxing and the best practices around API development and integration.</p>
