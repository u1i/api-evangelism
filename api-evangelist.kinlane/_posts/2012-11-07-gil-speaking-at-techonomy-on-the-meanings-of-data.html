<p>I'm digging on this statement from Gil Elbaz @ Factual. &nbsp;<span>Gil is participating on a panel &ldquo;The Forest for the Trees: The Meanings of Data&rdquo; at the&nbsp;<a href="http://techonomy.com/conf/12-tucson/" target="_blank">Techonomy Conference</a>&nbsp;</span><span>on Sunday, November 11th in Tucson, Arizona at the Ritz Carlton.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span><a href="http://blog.factual.com/gil-speaking-at-techonomy-on-the-meanings-of-data">We live in a world of patterns. Now we&rsquo;re getting better at discerning them. As we see the big patterns in human behavior, and in the movement of money, products, jobs, weather, energy, disease, and even molecules and stars, a new era of understanding dawns. Can companies and governments draw proper conclusions fast enough? Where will this world of patterns discerned take us?</a></span></p>
<p>I've heard Gil talk several times, and I am a big believer in his views on data, and supporter of <a href="http://www.factual.com/">Factual as a platform</a>. I firmly believe we can help companies and government draw proper conclusions, in very real-time ways, using APIs.</p>
