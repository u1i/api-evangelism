<p>It can be easy to stumble across the base URL for one of my APIs out on the open Internet. I design my APIs to be easily distributed, shared, and as accessible as possible--based upon what I feel the needs for the resource might be. You can find most of my APIs, as part of my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">master stack</a>, but there are other APIs like my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/screen-capture/">screen capture API</a>, or maybe my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/screen-capture/">image manipulation API</a>, that are often orphaned, which I know some people could use some help identifying more of the resources that are behind API operations.</p>
<p>To help support discovery across my network of APIs, I'm going to be supporting requests for Content-Type: application/apis+json for each endpoint, as well as an <a href="http://apisjson.org">apis.json file</a> in the root of the API, and supporting portal. An example of this in action, can be seen with my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/blog/">blog API</a>, where you can look into the root of the portal for API (<a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/blog/apis.json">kin-lane.github.io/blog/apis.json</a>), and in the root of the base URL for the API (<a href="http://blog.api.kinlane.com/apis.json">blog.api.kinlane.com/apis.json</a>), and for each individual endpoint, like the (<a href="http://blog.api.kinlane.com/blog/">blog.api.kinlane.com/blog/</a>) endpoint, you can request the&nbsp;Content-Type:&nbsp;application/apis+json, and get a view of the APIs.json discovery file.</p>
<p>It will take me a while to this rolled out across all of my APIs, I have worked out the details on my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/blog/">blog</a>, and <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/api/">API</a> APIs. Providing discovery at the portal, API, and endpoint level just works. It provides not just access to documentation, but the other critical aspects of API operations, in a machine readable way, wherever you need it. It is nice to be on the road to having APIs.json exist as the media type (application/apis+json), something that isn't formal yet, but we are getting much closer with the latest release, and planned releases.</p>
<p>Next, I will push out across all my APIs, and do another story to capture what things look at that point. Hopefully it is something I can encourage others to do eventually, making API discovery a little more ubiquitous across API operations.</p>
