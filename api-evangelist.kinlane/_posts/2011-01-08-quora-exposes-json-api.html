<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/quora-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />Quora has exposed a <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/definition-json.php" target="_blank">JSON</a>-based data API that allows users to access data about a currently logged-in user.<p></p>
To  request particular fields about the currently logged-in user, you can  add fields to a query string and append to  <a href="Quora Exposes JSON API" target="_blank">http://api.quora.com/api/logged_in_user</a>.<p></p>
Currently supported fields include:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Inbox</li>
	<li>Followers</li>
	<li>Following</li>
	<li>Notifs</li>
</ul>
Here is an example call:  <a href="http://api.quora.com/api/logged_in_user?fields=inbox,notifs">http://api.quora.com/api/logged_in_user?fields=inbox,notifs</a><p></p>
This will return Inbox and Notification related information for the authenticated user.<p></p>
This  is not a full-blown API release by Quora.  Quora engineer Edmond Lau  posted information on Quora about the API, stating that it is in its  alpha stage and is only meant to support existing <a href="http://www.quora.com/Is-anyone-working-on-a-Quora-Chrome-extension" target="_blank">Quora Chrome</a> and  <a href="http://www.quora.com/Is-anyone-working-on-a-Quora-Chrome-extension" target="_blank">Quora Firefox extensions</a>.<p></p>
Even  though it doesn't have all the supporting elements of an official API  release, the fact that the Q&amp;A startup has established <a href="http://api.quora.com/">api.quora.com</a> for its use, indicates that it plans to invest more energy around an official <a href="http://www.quora.com/Edmond-Lau/Quora-Extension-API" target="_blank">Quora API</a>.
