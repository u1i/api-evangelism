<p>Salesforce talked a little bit about its <a href="http://blogs.developerforce.com/developer-relations/2013/02/new-eclipse-plugin-available-february-15th.html">strategy around the development and release strategy around the Salesforce Eclipse plug-in</a>. &nbsp;Providing a little transparency into how they stagger its API releases as well as waiting to release their <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/" target="_blank">Eclipse</a> plug-in, until API release is complete.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more interested in this story from an <a href="/buildingblocks/">API building block</a> perspective.  An eclipse plug-in seems like a building block for only the most mature APIs out there, and especially ones targeting the enterprise.  An eclipse plug-in is not for every API, but I think I will add it as a building block to consider.</p>
<p>It also seems like something a 3rd party provider could step up and find success with as well, by building a single or suite of Eclipse plug-ins that provide integrated API developer tools across popular or high value web APIs for Eclipse users.</p>
<p>I believe IDE plug-ins for APIs will be one way we can provide API discovery solutions for developers, by bringing valuable, qualified API resources into their development environments.</p>
