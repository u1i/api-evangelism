<p>I first wrote about <a title="interactive API documentation with Posterous's new API area" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/06/17/deploying-smarter-api-documentation/">interactive API documentation with Posterous&rsquo;s new API area</a> in June 2011, then the follow-up when&nbsp;<a title="Mashery deploying their own version called I/O docs" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/07/26/mashery-delivers-smarter-api-documentation/">Mashery deployed their own version called I/O Docs</a> in July 2011.</p>
<p>Smart, interactive or I/O API documentation is an evolution of API documentation from static and often boring documentation, to more interactive and real-time experience, allowing you to make live calls against an API while also browsing the documentation that explains how it operates.</p>
<p>Peter Gruenbaum of <a title="SDK Bridge" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/serviceproviders/">SDK Bridge</a> has surveyed and done exhaustive research on <a title="what developers say about API documentation" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/05/20/what-developers-say-about-api-documentation/">what developers say about API documentation</a> and <a title="web api documentation best practices" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2010/08/12/web-api-documentation-best-practices/">web API documentation best practices</a>, proving that up to date, and complete documentation can be very successful in helping developers get up and running using an API.</p>
<p>The <a title="API Service Provider" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/serviceproviders/">API Service Provider</a>, <a title="3Scale" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/serviceproviders/3scale.php">3Scale</a> has stepped up with their own interactive API documentation for users of their platform using <a title="Swagger" href="http://swagger.wordnik.com/">Swagger</a>, an open-source framework that lets developers learn, play, test and debug each element of an API in real-time.</p>
<p>There are 3 main benefits for API owners coming from adopting <a title="Swagger" href="/2011/11/09/can-swagger-deliver-a-restful-api-discovery-service/">Swagger</a>:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Automated, consistent generation of clean, beautiful, interactive API documentation</li>
<li>Generation of client code and SDK in Scala, Java, Javascript, Ruby, PHP, and Actionscript 3</li>
<li>Feeding into an industry wide API discovery language that both developers and non-developers can use</li>
</ul>
<p>While many companies are providing <a title="API Explorer" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/buildingblocks/api_explorer.php">API explorers</a> for their developers to make live calls against their APIs, I think interactive documentation holds more value in educating developers about APIs, while also allowing them to make real-time calls.  My feeling is that this makes some tough concepts stickier while trying to understand and integrate with an API.</p>
<p>Visit the <a title="3Scale" href="http://www.3scale.net">3Scale</a> site for more information on using their <a title="API management platform for deploying interactive documentation" href="http://www.3scale.net/2012/01/24/interactive-api-documentation-the-new-api-console-for-developers/">API management platform for deploying interactive documentation</a>, using Swagger, for your APIs.</p>
<p><strong>Disclosure:</strong> &nbsp;I have consulted with 3Scale on industry strategy several times.</p>
