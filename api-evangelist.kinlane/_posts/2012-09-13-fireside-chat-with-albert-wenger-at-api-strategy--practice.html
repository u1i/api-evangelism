<p>We are at an exciting time right now with the <a title="API Strategy &amp; Practice" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Practice &amp; Strategy conference</a>, where we get to orchestrate the best lineup of speakers, sessions and panels possible.</p>
<p>I just added <a title="Steve Klabnik to our speaker line-up" href="/2012/09/13/steve-klabnik-added-to-speakers-at-api-strategy--conference/">Steve Klabnik to our speaker line-up</a> and now we are excited to announce we&rsquo;ll be having a fireside chat with Albert Wenger (<a title="albert wenger" href="https://twitter.com/albertwenger">@albertwenger</a>) of <a title="Union Square Ventures" href="http://www.usv.com/">Union Square Ventures (USV)</a>.</p>
<p>Albert combines over 10 years of entrepreneurial experience with an in-depth technology background. As an entrepreneur, he has founded or co-founded five companies, including a management consulting firm (in Germany), a hosted data analytics company, a technology subsidiary for Telebanc (now E*Tradebank), an early stage investment firm, and most recently (with his wife), DailyLit, a service for reading books by email or RSS.</p>
<p>Albert also served as the president of del.icio.us through the company's sale to Yahoo. His technology background goes back to winning the German national computer science competition at age 18. Albert graduated summa cum laude from Harvard College in economics and computer science and holds a Ph.D. in Information Technology from MIT. He has managed technology projects for organizations as diverse as Tacoda (startup) and Telebanc (leading Internet bank).</p>
<p>USV invests in companies that have large networks of engaged users, differentiated by user experience and defensible by network effects, so USV has a vested interest in understanding developer communities, how APIs will evolve, what types of businesses are best suited to an API driven strategy.</p>
<p>The <a title="API Strategy &amp; Practice" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Practice &amp; Strategy conference</a> fireside chat with Albert Wenger will reflect the tone of the conference, which is a blend of both the technical and business of APIs--providing what is essential for companies to be successful with their API driven strategies.</p>
