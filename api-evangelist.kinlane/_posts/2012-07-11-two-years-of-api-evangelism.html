<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/02/online-flashmob-platform-mobber-suspended-from-twitter-api-for-promoted-trends-copycat/">According to Techcrunch</a>, Twitter suspended <a title="Mobber" href="http://www.mobber.net/">Mobber</a>, a platform that rewards users for distributing promoted content through their social media accounts, from using the Twitter API.</p>
<p>Mobber's service is obviously in direct competition with <a title="Twitter's Promoted Trends" href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/282142-promoted-trends">Twitter's Promoted Trends</a>, part of Twitter's suite of advertising products, which also includes promoted accounts and promoted Tweets.</p>
<p>Of course it's Twitter's platform, they can shut off anyone's access, and easily file it under a terms of service violation.  But ultimately wouldn't it make more sense if <a title="Twitter opened it's advertising platform with APIs" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/07/29/api-driven-twitter-advertising/">Twitter opened it's advertising platform with APIs,</a> and allowed developers to innovate, enabling Twitter to still make money, but providing a much wider reach and audience?</p>
<p>Mobber's story is just another casualty in <a title="Twitter restricting developer access" href="/2012/06/29/twitter-continues-to-restrict-access-to-our-tweets/">Twitter recent efforts to take control of it's platform</a>, leaving developers to wonder, who is next?</p>
