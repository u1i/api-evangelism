<p>I was introduced to <a href="http://streamdata.io/">StreamData.io</a> the other day, by Gabriel Dillon (<a href="https://twitter.com/gjdillon">@gjdillon</a>) of <a href="http://readme.io/">Readme.io</a>. StreamData.io provides a caching, and push layer for apps to take advantage of, that can be deploy on top of existing APIs. I haven&rsquo;t implemented StreamData.io yet, I am still evaluating it, and at first glance it looks like an interesting new real-time layer, that you can use on top of APIs, to improve application performance and user experience.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to add StreamData.io to <a href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com/">my real-time research</a> right now, however once I start playing with I may add as an API deployment resource as well. I have some verification to do, but I&rsquo;d love to test out the potential for StreamData.io to deliver cache and sync layer for common APIs, doing for APIs, what StreamData.io is doing for apps&mdash;delivering on one of my ongoing ideas for caching high use APIs.</p>
<p>When I was working in Washington DC, I had the pleasure of working during the federal government shutdown, where I wrote a piece <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/01/can-we-depend-on-federal-government-apis/">asking if we can depend on our federal government APIs</a>, and talked about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/12/caching-apis-with-cloudformations-or-openshift-/">caching APIs with AWS cloud formations, or Open Shift</a>. My objective is to ensure there redundant sources for APIs coming out of government, providing developers with a more stable solution, they can depend on. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/18/multiple-types-of-apisjson-for-discovery/">I even added this thinking into the early APIs.json design, allowing you to define cached indexes of APIs</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve added <a href="http://streamdata.io/">StreamData.io</a> to <a href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com/">my real-time research</a>, and I&rsquo;ll get in there and play with more, as I have the time. Then I&rsquo;ll get a better understanding of what you can do with the API caching and syncing, seeing if it is possible to deliver this layer for my APIs as well as my apps&mdash;something that is even more appealing in this age of Docker containers. #FoodForThought</p>
