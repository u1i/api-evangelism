<p>I getting ready to heading to Berlin in the morning. I'm scheduled to speak at <a href="http://berlin.apidays.io/">APIDays Berlin</a> on Monday. APIDays is the sister site to #<a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/">APIStrat</a>, an event you will always find me at, no matter where it is at in the world.</p>
<p>APIDays has been pushing the conversation around APIs across Europe and the United States for a couple years now. While #APIStrat is focused on larger markets, and bigger events&mdash;APIDays is focused on new markets, and conversations within new business verticals, like the <a href="http://sf.apidays.io/">automobile API conversation, in San Francisco this June</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m scheduled for the end of the day Monday, so my talk titled &ldquo;The Kin Lane Show&rdquo;, will be a summary of the current state of API space, while also integrating the other talks I will see throughout the day. Something that will helps me fine tune a talk for a local audience and specifically for APIDays Berlin.</p>
<p>Hopefully you already have your tickets, if not you can catch me at the end of May at <a href="http://mediterranea.apidays.io/">APIDays Mediterranea in Barcelona</a>, and at <a href="http://sf.apidays.io/">APIDays San Francisco</a> in June.</p>
