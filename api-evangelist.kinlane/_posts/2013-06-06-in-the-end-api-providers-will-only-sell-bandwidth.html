<p>I got an email from <a title="IFTTT" href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> last night, simply stating:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>As of today, IFTTT has stopped supporting the Posterous Channel. The Channel has been removed, along with any Recipes that made use of Posterous Triggers or Actions.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at support@ifttt.com. Thanks for your continued support.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&mdash;The IFTTT Team&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>This announcement, follows a similar one a couple weeks ago, where <a href="http://thenextweb.com/twitter/2012/09/21/why-ifttt-forced-remove-twitter-triggers-red-alert-developers/">IFTT also ceased support for channels that pull your data from Twitter</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Since Posterous is owned by Twitter, it's easy to see the parallels in the decision by IFTTT. &nbsp;</p>
