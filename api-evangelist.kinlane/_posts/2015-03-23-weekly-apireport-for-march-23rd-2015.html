<p>Ok, it seems like Monday is going to be the regular posting day for my weekly API.Report. No matter how hard I try to get done over the weekend, something always seems to get in the way. Regardless, I'm still going to do, as the process is more than worth it.</p>
<p><span>The Weekly API.Report represents the best of what I've read throughout the week, and is only what I personally felt should be showcased. Each news item comes with a link, and some thoughts I had after curating the piece of API related news. I'm trying to break down stories into as coherent buckets as I can, but it remains something that is ever changing for me, but ultimately I will settle on a clear definition for each of the research areas.</span></p>
<p>A couple of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>3D printing</strong></span> footnotes for the week:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://3dprint.com/51988/3d-printed-twitter-mood-lamp/">3D Printed Twitter Mood Lamp Assesses the Emotional State of Denver Residents</a> - Not sure this is a realistic implementation, but I think the combo of 3D printing and social APIs, is an interesting crossover.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://hackaday.com/2015/03/18/adding-recycling-codes-to-3d-prints/">Adding Recycling Codes To 3D Prints</a> - Another potential interesting cross section of APIs and 3D printing. Seems like you could really go to down making 3D printed items that have a barcode, that is linked to online resources.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Accessibility</strong></span> is a critical aspect of the API space that needs more discussion:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/03/16/web-accessibility-with-accessibility-api/">Accessibility APIs: A Key To Web Accessibility</a> - This is an important aspect of the API conversation that isn't discussed, let alone APIs delivering a solution. I'm going to break this down, and try to incorporate accessibly into my research more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Only one <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>acquisitions</strong></span> I wanted to showcase this week:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2015/03/16/linkedin-acquires-hr-startup-careerify/">LinkedIn acquires HR startup Careerify</a> - Just keeping tabs on who buys who when it comes to API providers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interesting usage of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>analytics</strong></span> in an acronym, and some money rais'n:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.dataplumbing.com/blog/example-of-architecture-for-aaas-analytics-as-a-service">Example of architecture for AaaS (Analytics as a Service)</a> - I thought the title was a joke at first, but actually provides an interesting blueprint to use for API driven analytics. I'd ditch the acronym though. ;-)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/dataminr-raises-130-million-to-expand-enterprise-verticals-for-twitter-analytics/">Dataminr raises $130 million to expand enterprise verticals for Twitter analytics</a>&nbsp;- Lots of money in API driven analytics. We've seen this market stabilize with the world of social, but with the number of APIs out there, the Dataminr, Datasift, and other models will become relevant in other areas of data.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will be tracking on more <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>annotation</strong></span> related discussions in the future:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2015/03/16/youtube-introduces-interactive-cards-to-complement-annotations-and-they-work-on-mobile-too/">YouTube introduces interactive cards to complement annotations &ndash; and they work on mobile too</a> - I think normally I'd consider this an embeddable story, I'm going to be looking for annotation specific elements that are API driven. I am working on thoughts for an annotation layer for the API discovery layer, so I am beginning gather my thoughts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>API aggregation</strong></span> action, mostly from Google:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ProgrammableWeb/~3/EHwhV4mHNoQ/18">Peach Payments Launches Smart Payments Platform</a> - Aggregation happens in the most mature spaces, and payment is definitely one of the older space web APIs have been influencing.&nbsp;</li>

<p>That concludes my report on what I read last week across the API space. I'm still working on pulling together a summary e-newsletter version, allowing people to get an executive summary of what I thought was important from the week--I am hoping it will be available next week. I'm also going to auto-generate some visualizations, and summary counts for each week. I'd like to see a tag cloud, and overall counts to help me understand the scope of news I cover each week.</p>
<p>If you know of something I missed, feel free to email or tweet at me, and make sure I know about your company, and have a link to your blog RSS. If you don't tell the story and share, the world will never know it happened.</p>
<p>It is a good time to be tracking on the API space--lots going on!</p>
