<p>I spent some time this weekend updating a handful of my APIs to the new <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger 2.0 API definition format</a>. I was already using an older version of Swagger, so the migration wasn&rsquo;t too difficult. I have about five new APIs I want to roll out over the next couple weeks, and I wanted them to up to date, using the latest version, so moving forward my knowledge using my existing APIs was the best way to prepare.</p>
<p>I moved forward the five "<a href="http://developer.apievangelist.com/core-apis.html">core APIs</a>", as I call them, analysis, APIs, building blocks, curated, and tools, to all use Swagger 2.0. These APIs provide access to my monitoring system I use to keep track of the space. I also migrated two of my "<a href="http://developer.apievangelist.com/stack-apis.html">stack APIs</a>", i<a href="http://image.manipulation.apievangelist.com/">mage manipulation</a>, and <a href="http://screen-capture.apievangelist.com/">screen capture</a>, which are designed to be general purpose, utility APIs &nbsp;I use across my platform.</p>
<p>To support the migration I wrote a Swagger manager for my API monitoring system, which I use to track on 2794 APIs, from 3215 companies, which API Evangelist is one of these companies. Using this new tool I imported my old Swagger 1.2 versions, and after a little touching up in my new editor, I published brand spank&rsquo;n new Swagger 2.0 definitions for all seven my APIs.</p>
<p>The process reminded me of how API definitions really can help you describe, see, understand and ultimately communicate the API surface area you posses. I&rsquo;m going to take this and apply it to a couple of business sectors I&rsquo;m tracking on as part of my API Stack, and see what the process does for me there. After that I&rsquo;m going to get to work on the next five APIs I&rsquo;m designing, and see how Swagger 2.0 contributes to my design of brand new APIs, as well as later on in the life cycle.</p>
<p>I'm using my Swagger API definitions as a central truth for driving server side code, and my documentation. I&rsquo;m eager to continue exploring how it can further generate my client side code libraries, as well as SDKs, and help me better test, and monitor my APIs. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll perfectly automate every step in the API life cycle with Swagger, but it damn sure is making some of the steps much less painful, and following a central design truth, that in this case is a simple Swagger JSON file that I keep in a library, pushing forward my catalog of API resources, at the same time I push forward my own understand of what is possible.</p>
