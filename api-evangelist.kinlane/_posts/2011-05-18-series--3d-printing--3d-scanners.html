<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/3D-Printing/3d-printing-scanners.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />3D printing doesn't always start with a <a title="human designer or creator" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printing-the-creators/">human designer or creator.</a> There are wide variety of 3D scanners that can be used in the 3D printing process.</p>
<p>A 3D scanner is a device that analyzes a real-world object to collect data on its shape and possibly its appearance. The resulting data can then be used to construct 3D models.</p>
<p>3D scanning is no replacement for a human designer, but can offer a good start creating a 3D representation.</p>
<p>Each 3D scanner has its benefits and limitations, and resulting data will always need much work before it can be used in 3D printing.</p>
<p>3D scanners can offer a lot of benefit in rapid prototyping, and reverse engineering of existing objects.</p>
<p>Just like 3D printers you will find a wide range of 3D scanners, in both functionality and price.</p>
<p>You can also find innovative hobbyists employing tools like the Xbox Kinect for generating 3D scans.</p>
<p>3D Scanners are just the one possible link in an evolving <a title="3D print and manufacturing supplying chain" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printing-and-manufacturing-supply-chain/">3D print and manufacturing supply chain</a>.</p>
