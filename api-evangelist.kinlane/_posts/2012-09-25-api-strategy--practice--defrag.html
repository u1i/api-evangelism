<p>When you spend a lot of time going to conferences, hackathons and events, you start really getting picky about which events you go to. To disrupt my regular routine, I need an event that will always add value to my professional career, but also be a good time!</p>
<p>When it comes to the latest in Internet technolgy, I always make time each year for the Gluecon and Defrag conferences. <a title="Gluecon" href="http://gluecon.com/2012/">Gluecon</a> is usually in the spring and <a title="Defrag" href="http://www.defragcon.com/2012/">Defrag</a> is in the fall--both occurring at the Omni Interlocken in Broomfield, CO.</p>
<p><a title="Defrag Confernece" href="http://www.defragcon.com/2012/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/defrag-2012/Defrag-2012-Conference.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.defragcon.com/2012/">Defrag is coming up November 15th and 16th</a>--right after November 1st and 2nd for the&nbsp;<a title="API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/index.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice in NYC.</a></p>
<p>API Strategy &amp; Conference is psyched to be partnering with Defrag in our first year.  If you <a title="Register for API strategy" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/register.php">register for API Strategy &amp; Conference</a>, you will get 10% off of your registration for Defrag.</p>
<p>The event combination will make November a great time to immerse yourself in the API industry, with API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference, then two weeks later, go further with Internet technology discussions at Defrag.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing you at both <a title="API Strategy &amp; Practice" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/register.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference</a> and <a title="Defrag" href="http://www.defragcon.com/2012/">Defrag</a> in November!&nbsp;</p>
