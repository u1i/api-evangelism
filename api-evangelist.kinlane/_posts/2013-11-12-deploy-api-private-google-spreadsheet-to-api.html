<p>I'm working on a series of simple scripts that help people deploy APIs from some of the most common data sources. I'm starting with a series of PHP scripts, and next up is a private Google Spreadsheet to API, using JSON stored in Github.</p>
<p>For this PHP implementation, I'm using the <a href="http://www.slimframework.com/">SLIM framework</a>, which provides a dead simple REST framework you can use to deploy an API from a variety of data sources.   To begin deploying an API from your Google Spreadsheet datastore, download the REST library and upload to your server that runs PHP.</p>
<p>Slim is pretty straightforward to work with, to add each API endpoint you just add a single PHP file under methods. For this how-to guide we are going to add a simple endpoint from our JSON products data store.</p>
<p>This project also depends on the <a href="https://developers.google.com/drive/">Google Drive API</a> and I use the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/google-api-php-client/">Google API PHP Client</a> to connect to Google and provide necessary oAuth connectivity.&nbsp;</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/7439653.js"></script>
<p>Before all of this works you need to have an oAuth token, which I created a simple script to handle:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/7439681.js"></script>
<p>I leave it to you to figure out where you want to store your oAuth tokens, and other goods. I use a config.php file, but can easily be done from database or other:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/7439703.js"></script>
<p>Next you just add an include reference in the index page for your slim implementation:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/7439726.js"></script>
<p>This API just uses ID, Name, Price and Description of the product, and queries by a simple query parameter. You can use this as a template for your own product database, adding and removing fields as you need, or completely retrofitting for any database table.  That is it, now you have a simple product API that pulls a list of products from a private Google Spreadsheet data store.</p>
<p>This project is more excercise than anything else. I don't recommend deploying a public API driectly off a private Google Spreadsheet. Next up, will be to secure it using an <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">API infrastructure provider like 3Scale</a>, and possibly build in some caching.&nbsp;</p>
