<p>Google is using the <a href="http://googledevelopers.blogspot.com/2013/02/udacity-html5-game-development-course.html">online learning platform Udacity to teach developers about game development</a>.  The new <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cs255">HTML Game Development course</a> (CS255), is the online classroom for the programming class, coupled with a series of study groups hosted at Google's San Francisco office and a contest providing developers an incentive to complete the class.</p>
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/live/">Google is kicking off the course with a live session</a>, with Udacity CEO Sebastian Thrun on Thursday, February 14th at 10:30 AM and the class<span>&nbsp;will be taught by&nbsp;</span><a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/105062545746290691206/posts">Colt McAnlis</a><span>&nbsp;(Developer Advocate, Chrome Developer Relations),&nbsp;</span><a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/105062545746290691206/posts">Peter Lubbers</a><span>(Program Manager, Chrome Developer Relations), and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/105495497383489174073/posts">Sean Bennett</a><span>&nbsp;(Architect, Udacity).</span></p>
<p>The HTML Game Development course from Google is an interesting approach to developer education by providing an online course bundled with in-person or streamed workshops and study groups, bundled with a contest to help motivate students.</p>
<p>I may create a blueprint for other API providers to follow, when launching their own courses in a similar way to Google.</p>
