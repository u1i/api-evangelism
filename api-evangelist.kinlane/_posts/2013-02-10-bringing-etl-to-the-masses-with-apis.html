<p>I&rsquo;m spending a lot of time lately thinking about <a title="emerging trends in API usage" href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/">emerging trends in API usage</a>. One area I&rsquo;m tracking on, is around companies that are offering simple services that provide interoperability and automation between cloud platforms, using APIs.   The best known examples are from companies like <a title="IFTTT" href="http://ifttt.com">If This Then That (IFTTT)</a> and <a href="http://zapier.com">Zapier</a>, who provide end users with simple icon based tools for defining  tasks that move data between SaaS platforms.</p>
<p>Its tough to define this space, which in enterprise speak is really just <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load">Extract Transform Load (ETL)</a>, which is historically a process to migrate information between systems in an enterprise, using data sources and web services.  But with the popularity of web APIs, we need to rethink ETL in the context of the cloud and update how we approach interoperability between the growing number of API driven platforms.</p>
<p>Mike Reich of Seabourne, and I were discussing this last time I was in Washington D.C., and he currently has a great blog post on <a title="rethinking ETL in the API age" href="http://seabourneinc.com/2013/02/08/rethinking-etl-for-the-api-age/">rethinking ETL for the API age</a>.  If you don&rsquo;t know <a title="Seabourne" href="http://seabourneinc.com/">Seabourne</a>, they are behind high profile government projects like <a title="MyFCC" href="http://my.fcc.gov/">MyFCC</a> and <a title="GovInfo" href="http://govinfo.io/">GovInfo</a>.  They have been doing a lot of thinking about how to acquire, process and publish content with APIs.</p>
<p>To better help <span style="text-decoration: underline;">me</span>&nbsp;better understand the space, I&rsquo;m watching 12 service providers that I&rsquo;m putting in a bucket of what I consider the next generation of ETL providers:</p>

<p>I feel that this new group of ETL providers are focused sufficiently on the new world of API driven platforms, beyond just "data sources" and "web services".  There are more providers like <a href="http://apatar.com/">Apatar</a> and <a href="http://www.jitterbit.com/Solutions/etl-data-integration">Jitterbit</a>, but I feel these providers are more ETL than, than reflecting new breed of API interoperability providers (which I don&rsquo;t have proper name for yet).  One characteristic I&rsquo;m looking for is ease of use.  I think this new breed should be more for end-users, SaaS users and ultimately empowering the masses--not IT, which I feel ETL is designed for.</p>
<p>This new generation of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/interoperability.php">interoperability providers</a> should be about solving the problems average users face when operating online and in the cloud, and not just extracting, transforming and loading--making ETL something anyone can understand and put to use. &nbsp;Further democratizing IT resources, which is a common theme with SaaS, APIs, etc.</p>
<p>I think the new players like Zapier and IFTTT have to be concerned with getting too complex for everyday users, become more ETL, than being about solving end-user problems.  I think we will need very specialized, niche implementations--much like we are seeing with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/baas.php">BaaS</a> and the emergence of specialized versions like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/02/01/new-open-source-backend-as-a-services-platform-for-game-developers/">BaaS for gaming</a>.  Very niche versions of ETL like <a title="SortMyBox" href="http://www.sortmybox.com/">SortMyBox</a> and <a href="http://wappwolf.com/dropboxautomator/">WapWolf Dropbox Automator</a>, which focus only on solving file management problem users are facing, will be successful, because they are easy for users to understand and put to work.</p>
<p>I think there is an opportunity to quickly build the next generation ETL solutions that solve a set of automation, integration and interoperability problems for a niche audience using the simple icon based format we are seeing from providers like IFTT and <a title="Elastic.io" href="http://elastic.io/">Elastic.io</a>.  If you are considering building one of these new solutions, make sure and evaluate existing open source ETL solutions like:</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t reinvent the wheel, by rolling out your own ETL framework if at all possible.  This will allow you to focus on the specific acquire, transform and publish needs of your niche audience.  Even some of the new breed of providers are providing open source tools, like the <a href="https://github.com/rulesio/geekier/wiki">Geekier project</a> from <a href="https://rules.io/">Rules.io</a>, so do your homework. Also consider putting existing API aggregation providers like <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a> to use, providing faster acquire and publish API connections with popular APIs, while also standardizing the objects across all platforms.</p>
<p>I can envision video, photo, quantified-self and other niche services emerge that will empower any user to put APIs to use and acquire, transform and publish the valuable data, information and other content that are central to our increasingly fragmented online lives.  These new solutions will be framed in easy to understand terms that speak to specific audiences,  putting valuable API resources within reach of the masses.</p>
