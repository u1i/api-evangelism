<p>I just added a new feature to the right hand menu, for the podcast <a href="http://trafficandweather.io/">Traffic and Weather</a>, a podcast about APIs and the cloud from John Sheehan (<a href="https://twitter.com/johnsheehan">@johnsheehan</a>) and Steve Marx (<a href="https://twitter.com/smarx">@smarx</a>).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m big podcast fan, and I"m always looking for something I can listen to in the background while I&rsquo;m coding or writing stories. &nbsp;Traffic and Weather is great for this.</p>
<p>The podcast dives into various topics ranging from Webhooks to oAuth, but keeps things light, where I think even non-technical folks can get up to speed on the latest in the space.  John and Steve make things very informative, while being friendly and keeping it conversational.</p>
<p>I added a widget to my right hand menu, which will always pull the latest episode from Traffic and Weather.  You can also click on the logo to go directly to their site.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
