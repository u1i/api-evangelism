<p><img src="{{ page.image }}" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>I've been breaking down the work on banking APIs coming out of [Open Banking in the UK](http://apievangelist.com/2018/02/21/what-is-open-banking-in-the-uk/) lately. I recently took all their [OpenAPI definitions and published as a demo API developer portal](http://open.banking.blueprint.apievangelist.com/). Bringing the definitions out of the shadows a little bit, and showing was is possible with the specification. Pushing the project forward some more today I published [the Open Banking API Directory specification to the project](http://open.banking.blueprint.apievangelist.com/#Open Banking - Directory APIs), showing the surface area of the very interesting, and important component of open banking APIs in the UK.

The Open Banking Directory provides a pretty complete, albeit rough and technical approach to delivering observability for [the UK banking industry API ecosystem actor layer](http://apievangelist.com/2018/02/26/the-banking-api-actors-in-the-uk/). Everyone involved in the banking API ecosystem in UK has to be registered in the directory. It provides profiles of the banks, as well as any third party players. It really provides an unprecedented, industry level look at how you can make API ecosystems more transparent and observable. This thing doesn't exist at the startup level because nobody wants to be open with the number of developers, or much else regarding the operation of their APIs. Making any single, or industry level API ecosystem, operate as black boxes--even if they claim to be an "open API".

Could you imagine if API providers didn't handle their own API management layer, and an industry level organization would handle the registration, certification, directory, and dispute resolution between API providers and API consumers? Could you imagine if we could see the entire directory of Facebook and Twitter developers, understand what businesses and individuals were behind the bots and other applications? Imagine if API providers couldn't lie about the number of active developers, and we knew how many different APIs each application developers used? And it was all public data? An entirely different API landscape would exist, with entirely different incentive models around providing and consuming gAPIs.

The Open Banking Directory is an interesting precedent. It's not just an observable API authentication and management layer. It also is an API. Making the whole thing something that can be baked into the industry level, as well as each individual application. I'm going to have to simmer on this concept some more. I've thought a lot about collective API developer and client solutions, but never anything like this. I'm curious to see how this plays out in a heavily regulated country and industry, but also eager to think about how something like this might work (or not) in government API circles, or even in the private sector, within smaller, less regulated industries.
