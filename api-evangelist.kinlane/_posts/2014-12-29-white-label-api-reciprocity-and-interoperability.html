<p>I had someone ask me, if out of the 3<a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/companies.html">0 API reciprocity providers I track on</a>, if I knew if one of them offered white or private label services. I couldn&rsquo;t confidently say whether or not any of them did, and as I do with my other questions, the best way to find out, is to put it out into the universe, and see whether or not one of the providers will let me know, or one of them will do it.</p>
<p>It would make sense for companies like <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> to offer a solution that would allow for any company to resell their services, and offer specialty versions of their API reciprocity, interoperability, and automation services. As more companies are operating online, spread across various cloud environments, the need for ETL in the cloud, or like I prefer to call them, <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/">API reciprocity services</a>, is only going to increase.</p>
<p>Not all companies will want to use a Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions, and would prefer operating on-premise, and like to offer the services to their partners, or possibly their customers--opening up the need to brand it themselves. If you know one of the API reciprocity providers that offer anything like this, or plan on doing it, let me know. I have some people who have been asking for it, and would be happy to tell more stories about it.</p>
