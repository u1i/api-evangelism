<p>I usually don't have to look very far to find good examples of <a href="http://evangelism.apievangelist.com">API evangelism</a> in the field, because the best technology providers are usually pretty consistent and vocal about their practices--allowing me to just pluck from my feeds, and rework as a story for my API provider readership. One of the consistent sources for me out there is from the Docker community, and from what they like to call <a href="https://www.docker.com/community/docker-captains">Docker Captains</a>.</p>
<p>One of the things I see regularly from this Docker community leadership is the <a href="https://blog.docker.com/2016/09/docker-online-meetup-42-docker-captains-share-tips-tricks-using-docker-1-12/">sharing of their platform tips and tricks and in-person and online meetups</a>. This is definitely something I recommend other API providers do when possible, but I would also recommend working to integrate the concept into your regular evangelism activities like blogging, weekly newsletter, and Tweeting.</p>
<p>Maybe it is something you could also open up to the rest of the community. Allowing your trusted partners, and your favorite developers to share what their tips &amp; tricks are around API integration and usage are. The idea of tips and tricks is a pretty basic thing, but if you are working to stay creative in producing content, while also keeping things in the realm of actually helping your API developers be successful--it is one that can go a long way each week at meetups, on your blog, newsletter, Twitter, and across all the other channels you are already using to reach developers.</p>
