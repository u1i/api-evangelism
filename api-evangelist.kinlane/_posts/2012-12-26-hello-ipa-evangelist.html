<p>My name is Kin Lane, I am the <a href="http://apievangelist.com" target="_blank">API Evangelist</a>.</p>
<p>While traveling the globe, dedicating my life to API evangelism, I only drink one beer--IPAs.</p>
<p>Coincidence?  I think not!</p>
<p>This blog is dedicated to discussing the amazing world of India Pale Ales, also known as IPAs.</p>
<p>Once you have acquired the taste for the hoppiness of IPAs, you'll never go back.</p>
