<p>I ended up at the Punfork API today for some reason. Full disclosure: "Punchfork has been acquired by Pinterest! <a href="http://punchfork.com/pinterest" target="_blank">Read the announcement</a>. Site shutdown: March 31st, 2013".  Just getting that out of the way. While at the site, I ended up at the <a href="http://punchfork.com/goodies/badges">Goodies page</a>, which I think represents a nice set of basic embeddable tools for an API.</p>
<p>First using Punchfork Badges, you can customize a badge, then copy and paste the embed code onto your blog's sidebar, or anywhere else you want it to appear:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/punchfork/punchfork-badges.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>Then you can download a Punchfork logo (ok, its just one, but it gets point across):</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/punchfork/punchfork-logos.png" alt="" width="250" /></p>
<p>Last, you can enter your address and request a Punchfork sticker to be sent to you:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/punchfork/punchfork-stickers.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>These are all three, simple examples of a good approach to providing embeddable tools for users.  Badges are pretty straightforward, and it is sensible to provide logos and other images as part of a healthy branding strategy.  But the request for a sticker is something I haven't added to my listing of embeddable building blocks. After thinking about it, stickers are the OG embeddable tool.  Something your users can take offline, and embed anywhere.</p>
<p>At some point I will do a roundup of all the embeddable building blocks, since I've been adding some new ones like sticker request form.</p>
