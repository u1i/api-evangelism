<p>The <a title="Backend as a Service" href="/trends/baas.php">Backend as a Service (BaaS)</a> space is picking up momentum in 2013.  I&rsquo;m tracking on 20 BaaS providers, in hopes of better understanding what is being offered in this space.  Today I came across an interesting new, open source BaaS platform, being developed in the European Union called <a href="http://www.openi-ict.eu/" target="_blank">OPENi</a>.</p>
<p>The project describes itself as:</p>
<blockquote><em>OPENi is a European Union ICT Framework Programme (FP7) Information and communications technology (ICT) Collaborative project. Over the 30 month project duration we aim to deliver an open-source, cloud based platform for integrating mobile services.</em></blockquote>
<p>With a mission to:</p>
<blockquote><em>Our mission is to inspire innovation in the European mobile applications industry, by radically improving the interoperability of cloud-based services and trust in personal cloud storage through the development of a consumer-centric, open source mobile cloud applications platform.</em></blockquote>
<p>With the following objective:</p>
<blockquote><em>OPENi&rsquo;s objective is to directly address the lack of interoperability between cloud based services and enable applications to access and use a broad spectrum of existing cloud based functionality and content, consistently across different devices and platforms, in a way that enables a user-centric application experience. Targeting the needs of Application Developers, Services Providers and Consumers, OPENi will realize its vision for user-centric, cloud-connected, mobile applications.</em></blockquote>
<p>OPENi is a 30 month project, we will have to wait and see what comes out of the iniative. With the EU approach to open data and data privacy, I think there is a lot of potential to deploy and consume APIs, as well as delivering API automation, interoperability and backend platforms that have a healthy, consumer-centric approach--which I believe will be good for business, because its good for ender users.</p>
<p>In early 2013 the OPENi team will release software for the BaaS platform as an open-source project on github.com.  When released I will evaluate it side by side with the other BaaS providers I&rdquo;m tracking on.</p>
