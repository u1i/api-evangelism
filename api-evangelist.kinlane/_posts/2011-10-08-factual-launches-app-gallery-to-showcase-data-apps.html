<p><a href="http://blog.factual.com/factual-app-gallery">Factual has launch a new application gallery</a> to showcase the diverse number of applications built using data provided by Factual.</p>
<p>You can search for apps, browse by category, and filter by open source, paid or free apps. &nbsp;Looks like there are about 18 apps in the directory currently ranging from augmented reality to daily deals.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.factual.com/gallery">Factual App Gallery</a> isn&rsquo;t a particularly unique launch, we are seeing <a title="App Showcase" href="/buildingblocks/app_gallery.php">app showcases</a> popup within many APIs, but it shows that Factual is gaining steam, and I think it shows the appetite for building apps around datasets is growing.</p>
