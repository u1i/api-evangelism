<p>I'm working on an <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/fafsa-api/index.html">API design for the free application for federal student aid form</a>, also known as FAFSA, over the last couple weeks. I took <a href="http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/fotw1314/pdf/PdfFafsa13-14.pdf">the form</a> which had over 150 separate fields, and turned into a basic create, read, update and delete (CRUD) API. I even added an endpoint that allows you to query and get a list of the fields.</p>
<p>The project is a proof of concept to show the Department of Education what is possible around a FAFSA API. I'm not sure if the API will ever be deployed or adopted by the Department of Education or if by other 3rd party providers, establishing a sort of federated FAFSA API network. My goal is to just generate the API definition with supporting server and client side tooling, to show what is possible.</p>
<p>As I assess my work over the last couple weeks on FAFSA, I can't help but think how this should be standard practice for all forms. If you do a simple search at google for "<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=forms&amp;oq=forms&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i65j69i60l3j69i59.752j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=91&amp;ie=UTF-8">forms</a>", you get IRS forms, immigration, legal, voter registration and yes the FAFSA forms. It is clear that forms still dominate our lives--print and PDF.</p>
<p>I'm thinking that simple, open designs and tooling around forms would help us continue evolve the concept of the "form" beyond the just the PDF. Sure the PDF still has a place, and some tooling can work with consuming and publishing as PDF, but APIs could help us innovate around what is a form, how users enter their data into them, and take advantage of newer technologies like tablets.</p>
<p>In my opinion, every form should be an API. If you'd like help developing a new form as an API or evolving an older print or PDF form as an API, feel free to <a href="http://kinlane.com/contact/">reach out</a>.</p>
