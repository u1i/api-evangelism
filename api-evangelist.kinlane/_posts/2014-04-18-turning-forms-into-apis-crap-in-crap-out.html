<p>I&rsquo;ve been involved in a lot of conversations lately around turning government forms into APIs. Which seems like a great idea, right up until the part where I&rsquo;m thinking about the original workflow represented by many legacy forms, and realize that maybe this form was a bad idea to begin with.</p>
<p>If I develop an API for a form, and the original form all by itself is a bad idea, am I just making a bad idea worse, by attaching an API to it? I'd say yes!</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel like this will be true in all situations. I think APIs will allow us to hopefully break free of what the original intent of a form was, explore new opportunities for gathering and managing data, and changing the concept of what a form is.</p>
<p>Even with the potential, I can&rsquo;t help but think APIs on forms may not be good in all scenarios. Then again, this isn&rsquo;t just limited to forms, before we attach an API to anything, we should probably think&mdash;is this a good idea?</p>
