<p>I like a good API shirt. &nbsp;If you've ever seen me in person you've seen my API Evangelist shirt(s). &nbsp;At least you guys hope its multiple shirts, otherwise...ewwwee!</p>
<p>I recently started a new design - my&nbsp;<a href="/2012/12/13/get-my-new-che-p.i.-shirts/">Che P.I. t-shirt.</a> &nbsp;</p>
<p>There is an OG API t-shirt that recirculated this week for me--the <a href="http://schwag.140proof.com/product/capitalism-t-shirt">You Can't Spell Capitalism Without API</a>. &nbsp;This is an awesome shirt from the <a href="http://www.140proof.com/">social advertising platform, 140 Proof</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>140 Proof launched the shirt at the Twitter Chirp Conference, and I think it is a classic, that should never go away.</p>
<p>I'm ordering one for christmas!</p>
