<p>I&rsquo;m stoked to announce that <a title="Steve Klabnik" href="http://www.steveklabnik.com/">Steve Klabnik</a> will be speaking at the <a title="API Strategy &amp; Practice" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/speakers.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice conference</a>, November 1st &amp; 2nd in New York City.  I just added him to the homepage and <a title="API Speakers" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/speakers.php">speaker line-up</a>.</p>
<p>Steve is a highly respected Ruby developer, software craftsman, and an aspiring digital humanities scholar. He spends most of his time contributing to Open Source projects, and maintains both <a title="Hackety Hack" href="http://hackety.com/">Hackety Hack</a> and <a title="Shoes" href="http://shoesrb.com/">Shoes</a>, while also teaching and helping develop curriculum for&nbsp;<a title="JumpStart Labs" href="http://www.jumpstartlab.com/">Jumpstart Lab</a>.</p>
<p>Steve has has written book on <a title="Designing Hypermedia APIs" href="http://designinghypermediaapis.com/">Designing Hypermedia APIs</a>. Well it&rsquo;s better than a book.  I&rsquo;d call it a "living digital book". One where you can constantly come back and get fresh content and interact with the books community and author.  Much better than  the old-school programming book, which you buy once and it sits on your shelf.</p>
<p>What intrigues me about Steve, is that his perspective is very technical, but in his own words, &ldquo;<em>I've found a place between the sciences and the humanities.</em>&rdquo;  Which is a point of view we need to give a platform to, and everyone in Silicon Valley needs to listen.</p>
<p>Steve is exactly the fresh perspective we want to get at the <a title="API Strategy &amp; Practice" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/speakers.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice conference</a>.  I hope you can join us for the two day event in November and be there in person for Steve&rsquo;s talk.</p>
