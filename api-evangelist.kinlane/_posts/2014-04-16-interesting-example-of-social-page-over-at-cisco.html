<p>Its not often I find myself referencing Cisco when it comes to shedding light on interesting practices for the API space, but today is not your usual day.</p>
<p>At some point yesterday, I found myself at cisco.com, and I stumbled across their <a href="http://socialmedia.cisco.com/">social page</a>, which gives equal real estate to their blog, Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and Youtube channel, as well as highlights from their community forum.</p>
<p><a href="http://socialmedia.cisco.com/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/cisco/cisco-social-page.png" alt="" width="575" /></a></p>
<p>I like the idea of having a page like this for API providers. It helps you establish a single page, that can act as a one-stop shop for getting information about what is going on within an API community.</p>
<p>From a planning perspective it also helps providers understand they need to have more than one channel when it comes to providing API support via social channels.</p>
<p>Cisco&rsquo;s social media page is a pretty basic example, but I think a potentially powerful one that API providers can follow when organizing their own social platform, for their own API communities.</p>
