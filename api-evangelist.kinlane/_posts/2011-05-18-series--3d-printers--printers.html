<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/3D-Printing/3d-printing-printers.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />A 3D printer works by taking a 3D model, then by making a series of slices that are printed one on top of the other to create a 3D object of the model.<p></p>
Since 2003 there has been large growth in the sale of 3D printers, due to the decline in their cost.<p></p>
You can find 3D printing used in jewellery, footwear, industrial design, architecture, engineering, construction, automotive, aerospace, dental, medical and a wide variety of other industries.<p></p>
There are different types of 3D printers from low cost <a title="Makerbot" href="http://www.makerbot.com/">Makerbot</a> printers for around $1500 to higher end <a title="ZCorp" href="http://www.zcorp.com/en/home.aspx">ZCorp</a> printers running around $60,000.<p></p>
There has even been buzz around <a href="http://dornob.com/3d-printer-diy-home-factory-real-life-replicator/">3D printers being able to print most of their own parts</a>, enabling 3D printers to recreate themselves.<p></p>
Companies offering the the services of 3D printers range from hobbyists to publicly traded companies like <a title="Stratsys" href="http://www.stratasys.com/">Stratasys</a>.<p></p>
3D printers are just the golden piece of technology, making the entire <a title="3D print and manufacturing supply chain" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printing-and-manufacturing-supply-chain/">3D print and manufacturing supply chain</a> possible.
