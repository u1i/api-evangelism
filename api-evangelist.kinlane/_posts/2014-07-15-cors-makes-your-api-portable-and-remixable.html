<p>I was looking through <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/10/looking-at-77-federal-government-api-developer-portals-and-190-apis">federal government APIs</a> the other day, looking for the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/10/low-hanging-fruit-for-api-discovery-in-the-federal-government">low hanging fruit</a>, when it came to making government APIs more discoverable using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>. During my initial work, I played with <a href="http://www.usa.gov.apievangelist.com/">three separate APIs from www.usa.gov</a>, which I think demonstrates the importance of CORS, and how opening it up for APIs, makes them more portable and remix-able.</p>
<p>When it comes to the the three APIs from www.usa.gov, I do not have control over the API itself, but I wanted to create a self contained, site that showcased the government APIs, and provide interactive API documentation generated using Swagger. I made sure all three of the APIs had machine readable API definitions using Swagger, then I setup a simple HTML page, which allowed anyone to play with each of the APIs.</p>
<p>This worked great until I reached the third API, which was at a different domain than the previous two, and didn't have CORS enabled. If you aren't familiar with CORS, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing">Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)</a>, which is a mechanism that allows many resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain the resource originated from&mdash;behavior that you may want to control on a web page, but for an API it is something you want to encourage.</p>
<p>CORS being enabled, is the difference between an API being portable, and remix-able, and it being locked down to its original developer portal. If an API is RESTful and has CORS enabled, any outside party (like me), can generate a machine readable API definitions for it, and compose a developer experience, that that includes the API&mdash;with or without consent of the original API provider. While this might scare the shit out of some API providers, it is the future of API driven, application architecture.</p>
<p>You can't expect all developers to find your API developer portal, and APIs need to be more portable, allowing for remixing by other API providers, backend as a service providers, and anyone who wants to feature the API resource in their developer portal. CORS is a simple thing that you can enable for your APIs that will make a big difference in how your API is found, and integrated into other applications and systems.</p><p><strong>Updated November 27, 2015:</strong> Links were updated as part of switch from Swagger to OADF (<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/" style="text-decoration:none;"><strong>READ MORE</strong></a>)
