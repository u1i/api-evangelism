<p>I'm working on a variety of ways that anyone can easily deploy API on common cloud platforms. I'm working through a series of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/22/api-deployment-from-mysql-json-github-and-google-spreadsheets/">open</a> and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/11/16/secure-api-deployment-from-mysql-json-github-and-google-spreadsheets/">secure</a>, modular API demos written in PHP, using the Slim framework.</p>
<p>All of these demos are pretty basic, but currently I'm deploying them on Amazon EC2, because it is where most of my infrastructure runs and a top platform with wide user base. Ultimately my goal is to make them as simple to deploy as I possibly can, and while EC2 is definitely the leader, I know there are even simpler ways to launch simple APIs in the clouds.</p>
<p>I was doing a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/us-government-apis/1zVJwxQfyBw">survey of which PaaS platforms government agencies allow their workers to deploy projects on</a>, via the US government API group and was reminded of <a href="https://www.openshift.com/">OpenShift</a>, from Redhat. If you aren't familiar with OpenShift, it is a PaaS platform that allows you to define applications in a variety of languages, then deploy, automate, manage and scale in a very modular way.</p>
<p>With OpenShift I can define a very modular application, such as an API running PHP, using Slim framework and even apply what is known as a database cartridge, providing MySQL or Postgres storage for the API--all with a single command line.  I can instruct each application to derive its code from a Git location, allowing me to manage a central library of applications, then deploy specific instances as needed.</p>
<p>While I'm heavily using Github as the primary place to deploy <a href="http://spa.apievangelist.com/">single page applications</a>, that are completely written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JSON, I still need server side locations to rapidly deploy API driven resources in PHP, Python, Ruby and Node.  OpenShift is a much more modular approach that AWS, and while I'll still be using Amazon for many of my deployments I'm going to play around more with what is possible on OpenShift.</p>
<p>What I really like about this approach, in addition to the modular design is that I can maintain blueprints for common APIs on Github and reference these designs when deploying APIs via OpenShift. This matches up well with what I'm doing with <a title="api.ongithub.com " href="http://api.ongithub.com">api.ongithub.com</a> and <a title="data.ongithub.com" href="http://data.ongithub.com">data.ongithub.com</a> where I working to define simple Git driven approaches to open data and APIs.</p>
<p>Good stuff, I look forward to playing around more.</p>
