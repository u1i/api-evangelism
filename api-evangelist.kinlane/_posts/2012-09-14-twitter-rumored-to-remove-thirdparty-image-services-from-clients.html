<p>I was just reading a post via <a title="BuzzFeed" href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/">Buzzfeed</a>, that <a title="Twitter was going to remove third-party image services from its apps" href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/jwherrman/twitter-is-removing-third-party-image-services-fro">Twitter was going to remove third-party image services from its apps</a>.  <em>&ldquo;According to a person who was briefed on the company's plans&rdquo;</em>, the changes will be coming in the next updates to the Twitter client(s).</p>
<p>"They're trying to control those eyeballs on their apps, they're an ad-based company, they make money that way,&rdquo; says Twitpic founder Noah Everett, according to&nbsp;<a title="BuzzFeed" href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/">Buzzfeed</a>.</p>
<p>One thing is clear. Twitter is serious in its effort to take control over its ecosystem. &nbsp;It has a plan, and it's systematically rolling it out, taking control over each area it needs to maximize "promoted" revenue.</p>
