<p>There are a lot of high value APIs emerging these days,  APIs with access to essential business data, resources and intelligence.</p>
<p>When designing your API you want to make the interface as intuitive as possible, and ensure&nbsp;as wide as access to it as you possibly can.&nbsp;To quote Jonathan Schwartz, Sun CEO regarding Java APIs:</p>
<blockquote><em>"We wanted to build the biggest tent and invite as many people as possible,&rdquo; Schwartz said. &ldquo;You have open APIs and compete on implementations."</em></blockquote>
<p>To do this, I encourage building tools and widgets that non-developers can use when working with your API.  A great example of this is at Google, with their <a title="Google Analytics Dashboard" href="http://analytics-api-samples.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/reporting/javascript/ez-ga-dash/docs/user-documentation.html">Google Analytics Dashboard Library</a>.  Google wanted to make it <a title="easier for users to deploy a dashboard" href="http://analytics.blogspot.com/2012/05/new-google-analytics-easy-dashboard.html">easier for users to deploy a dashboard</a> that was tailored specifically for their business, so using a team of University of California Irvine students, they set out to simplify it down to 3 steps:</p>
<ol class="mainlist">
<li>Register with Google APIs Console.</li>
<li>Copy and paste the JavaScript code.</li>
<li>Configure this code to query your data and choose a chart type to visualize it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, you still have to be JavaScript savvy to work with the Google Analytics Dashboard Library, understand how to edit your site, and be fluent in Google Analytics--but it&rsquo;s a step closer to providing wider access to the power of the <a title="Google Analytics API" href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics API</a>, beyond just the development community.</p>
<p>LinkedIn also has some great examples of taking concept this to the next level with their <a title="plugin builders" href="https://developer.linkedin.com/plugins/member-profile-plugin-generator">&ldquo;plugin&rdquo; builders</a> which essentially generates the widgets for users, using the API. Since Google is going to keep working with the Google Analytics Dashboard Library over the next 3 quarters, so I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll see their library evolve as well.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll keep exploring other great examples of API embeddable strategies that can potentially bring in a much wider audience, opening up your API for access beyond developers, potentially bringing in other more business oriented groups.</p>
