SOAP uses Extensible Markup Language (XML) for its message format.  The SOAP Messaging Framework consists of:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Processing Model</strong> - Rules for processing a SOAP message</li>
	<li><strong>Extensibility Model</strong> - SOAP features and SOAP modules</li>
	<li><strong>Underlying Protocol Binding Framework</strong> - Rules for defining a binding to an underlying protocol that can be used for exchanging SOAP messages</li>
	<li><strong>Message Construct</strong> - Structure of a SOAP message</li>
</ul>
A SOAP message returning a users information might look like:

SOAP was originally designed in 1998 as a Microsoft project and became a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/soap/" target="_blank">W3C Recommendation</a> in June 2003.<p></p>
Even though SOAP has a long history with enterprise development, it has not seen the same adoption with the web 2.0 developer community, in no small part due to its complex and verbose nature.<p></p>
SOAP is far from dead, but in the new generation of web-based APIs, RESTful interfaces returning JSON are fast replacing the bulky SOAP interfaces that returns XML.
