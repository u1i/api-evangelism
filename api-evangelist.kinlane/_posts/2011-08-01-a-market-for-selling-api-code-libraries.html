<a title="PHP code library for the Github Gist API" href="http://codecanyon.net/item/gist-api/410684"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/php-scripts-codecanon-gist-api.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>One of my Google Alerts picked up on something interesting today. A <a title="PHP code library for the Github Gist API" href="http://codecanyon.net/item/gist-api/410684">PHP code library for the Github Gist API</a>, for sale on the code marketplace <a title="CodeCanyon" href="http://codecanyon.net/">CodeCanyon</a> for $2.00.
<p></p>I almost just closed the window, but then thought a little more about it. I think its the first time I've seen a code libraries for sale like this. I've seen more robust integrations and API clients for sale, but never a simple library for working with an API.
<p></p>The <a title="Github Gist API" href="http://develop.github.com/p/general.html">Github Gist API</a> is well documented and there is a <a title="PHP Library for the Github API" href="https://github.com/ornicar/php-github-api">PHP library for the Github API</a> available for free on the site. It doesn't look like it has Gist API support yet, but is well written, and shows you how to exend the PHP class.
<p></p>Seems like there is a narrow window where you could build an API code library and make money off selling it before a free library is available, or is it also possible to sell them even when there are other free libraries available?
<p></p>I will keep watching for other API code libraries for sell on CodeCanyon and elsewhere, see if this is a growing trend. I prefer to just open source mine on <a title="Github" href="http://www.github.com">Github</a>, for the entire community to put to use.
