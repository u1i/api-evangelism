<p>In May 2011 I released a book called the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Business-APIs-1-Kin-Lane/dp/1461113881/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1304210432&amp;sr=1-5">Business of APIs</a>. The book was intended to be an introductory walkthrough for non-technical people, to the world of APIs. I wanted to educate business, organizational and governmental leaders about the space, and the important role of APIs in having a healthy digital strategy.</p>
<p>Its coming up on two years later, and I'm finally getting around to updating the Business of APIs. After a nice long walk on the strand with <a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a>, we have the outline for the next version:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>What is an API?</li>
<li>What are APIs used for?</li>
<li>The history of APIs</li>
<li>What goes into an API?</li>
<li>Do you need an API?</li>
<li>How do you get an API??</li>
<li>What are the common building blocks of an API?</li>
<li>What are possible business models for an API?</li>
<li>How do you evangelize and support an API?</li>
<li>Where have some APIs stumbled?</li>
<li>APIs, a new way of doing business</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of the Business of APIs is the same. Help anyone, from any company, organization or the government understand what an API is, and why they are important. &nbsp;You don't have to be a developer to put APIs to use, this book is for everyone.</p>
<p>Look for an updated version of the Business of APIs by June. I'll still keep it a simple guide to the space, but provide a whole lot more information that will help you understand the Business of APIs.</p>
