<p><a href="https://github.com/interagent/http-api-design">I stumbled across a cool resource out of Heroku today, their </a><a href="https://github.com/interagent/http-api-design">HTTP API design guide</a>, which intends to direct practices for API design on the Heroku API platform.</p>
<p>Heroku&rsquo;s goals around APIs design are, "consistency and focusing on business logic while avoiding design bikeshedding&rdquo;.  They put out the guide to drive consistent aPI design practices at Heroku, but are also interested in sharing with the wider API community.</p>
<p>I think API design best practices are something every API provider should have, and publish publicly (on Github). I think it is ok to even fork, and modify existing guides like Heroku&rsquo;s or maybe <a href="https://github.com/18F/api-standards">from 18F out of federal government</a>. This most important thing is that you have a guide that can guide your team, or other teams within your organization.</p>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;m seeing more of these, I will start flagging, and aggregating them so we can browse and continue learn the API design practices from the leading API providers out there.</p>
