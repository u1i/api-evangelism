<a href="http://www.granatapet.de/">GranataPet</a>, a German dog food manufacturer, created a <a href="http://blog.foursquare.com/2011/03/31/api-highlight-a-special-for-our-four-legged-friends/">billboard that dispenses a treat for your dog when you check in to it using Foursquare</a>.<p></p>
Think about the possibilities when you have signs, billboards, and other types of display that either respond or dispense something when you interact via your mobile phone and an API.<p></p>
Opens up a whole lot of possibilities when you have devices that monitor APIs for specific triggers, respond accordingly, and then developers build software on top of those APIs.
