<p>I track on the different approaches used by API providers so that I know where to find examples of leading approaches to API design and deployment. Then I write about them so that I have something to reference across my research. I keep an eye out for <a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com/apis/">API providers who employ hypermedia as part of their API design</a>, as well as companies who are putting HTTP/2 to work as part of their design and deployment.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/docs/managing-an-http-2-connection">The Amazon Alexa Voice Service API employs HTTP/2 as part of their voice-enablement platform</a>. I'm still learning about HTTP/2 so I was pleased to see the amount of education they provide in their documentation, outlining some of the key terms and concepts at play;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frame:</strong>&nbsp;The basic protocol unit in HTTP/2; each frame serves a different purpose, for example, HEADERS and DATA frames form the basis of HTTP requests and responses.</li>
<li><strong>Stream:</strong>&nbsp;An independent, bi-directional sequence of frames exchanged between a client and server within an HTTP/2 connection. For detailed information, see&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-5">Streams and Multiplexing in RFC 7540</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Interfaces:</strong>&nbsp;AVS exposes interfaces (SpeechRecognizer, AudioPlayer, SynchronizeState, etc.) that provide your product access to Alexa&rsquo;s built-in skills.</li>
<li><strong>Downchannel:</strong>&nbsp;A stream you create in your HTTP/2 connection, which is used to deliver directives from the cloud to your client. The downchannel remains open in a half-closed state from the device and open from AVS for the life of the connection. The downchannel is primarily used to send cloud-initiated directives and audio attachments to your client</li>
<li><strong>Cloud-initiated Directives:</strong>&nbsp;Directives sent from the cloud to your client. For example, when a user adjusts device volume from the Amazon Alexa App, a directive is sent to your product without a corresponding voice request.</li>
</ul>
<p>They also provide details on crafting the&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/docs/avs-http2-requests#headers">HTTP/2 Message Headers</a>, how to construct the&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/docs/avs-http2-requests#messages">HTTP/2 Multipart Messages</a>, and what to expect with&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/docs/avs-http2-requests#responses">HTTP/2 Responses</a>. They have language SDKs in C / C++(<a href="https://nghttp2.org/">nghttp2</a>), C / C++(<a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">curl and libcurl</a>), Java (<a href="https://github.com/square/okhttp">OkHttp</a>), Java <a href="http://netty.io/">Netty</a>), Java(<a href="http://git.eclipse.org/c/jetty/org.eclipse.jetty.project.git/tree/?h=master">Jetty</a>). I am particularly interested in learning more about how the "Cloud-initiated Directives" works, allowing actions to be sent as part of each connection.</p>
<p>I'm tracking on the moving parts so that I can evolve my own understanding of HTTP/2 in action, and start building a list of APIs who are taking a step forward when it comes to their HTTP infrastructure. It helps to have several different providers to point at when I'm talking about new approaches. I also like to aggregate the common elements that are&nbsp;present, and hopefully, begin to establish a common set of building blocks present when HTTP/2 is put to use.&nbsp;</p>
