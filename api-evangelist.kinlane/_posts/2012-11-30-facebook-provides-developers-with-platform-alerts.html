<p>Right before the Thanksgiving holiday, in an effort to make the Facebook platform more responsive and dependable for developers, <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2012/11/15/delivering-important-alerts-about-your-app/">Facebook announced Developer Alerts</a>.  Developer alerts are a way for Facebook platform developers to receive critical information about their apps via email or Facebook notification.</p>
<p>Facebook Developer Alerts provide the following for Facebook app administrators:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Breaking Changes </strong>- If your app is using functionality that FB is changing or removing, you will be sent an alert at least 90 days before the change goes into effect</li>
<li><strong>App Status Changes</strong> - If you have submitted Open Graph actions or created an app detail page for App Center, FB will use Developer Alerts to notify you when the status of your submission changes</li>
<li><strong>Policy Violations and Enforcement -</strong> If your app doesn&rsquo;t adhere to FB Platform Policies you will be notified through these alerts</li>
</ul>
<p>Facebook Developer Alerts are more than notifications, it is an issue management system which will allow multiple developers on a project to known when action is required or things have been resolved.</p>
<p>It seems like a great approach to improving communications between API platforms and its API application developers.  I think I will add platform alerts as an official API building block, and recommend it as something API should consider when developing their platform.</p>
