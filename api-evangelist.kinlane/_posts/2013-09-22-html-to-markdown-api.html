<p>I'm slowly getting my blog world in order after the move from my own proprietary blogging platform to using Github + Jekyll hosted using Github Pages.</p>
<p>I've been using HTML pages for blog posts at <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, <a href="http://kinlane.com">Kin Lane</a> and other blogs, with 3 years of blog posts at API Evangelist and about 6 years at Kin Lane. There is a lot of legacy content to move from my EC2 driven blogs to Github.</p>
<p>Every time I would try and publish the posts as is, Github would reject my commit when it hit posts that didn't have compliant HTML, making it near impossible to publish everything.  I was trying to clean up as much of it as I could, but it wasn't good enough.  I needed a way to convert to markdown and clean house.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Ben Balter(<a href="/admin/blog/BenBalter">@BenBalter</a>) from Github recommend a very cool API called <a href="http://fuckyeahmarkdown.com/#api">Fuck Yeah Markdown</a>, which takes my legacy HTML pages and converts it to much cleaner markdown.</p>
<p>When I first started using Jekyll I wasn't really sold on markdown, in my mind I didn't mind hand rolling my HTML tags--I have been doing it for years. After Ben suggested I use markdown in my newly minted Github Jekyll projects I started to see the benefits.  It is way easier to manage content that is being published as a blog, page or otherwise when it is markdown.</p>
<p>I am just finishing up converting all of API Evangelist and Kin Lane to use markdown, and will be using the <a href="http://fuckyeahmarkdown.com/#api">Fuck Yeah Markdown API</a> to convert blog posts from HTML generated in my blog editor to markdown before publishing to Github.</p>
