<p>This is one of those regular public service announcements that if at all possible, you should be requiring SSL for all your API calls. I recently got an email from the IBM Watson team telling me that they would be enforcing encryption on all calls to the Alchemy API in February.</p>
<p>SSL is something I've started enforcing on my own internal APIs. I do not have wide usage of my APIs by third-party providers, but I do have a variety of systems making calls to my APIs, transmitting some potentially sensitive&nbsp;information--luckily nothing too serious, as I'm just a simple API Evangelist.</p>
<p><a href="http://encryption.apievangelist.com/">Encryption is an area I research regularly</a>, hoping to stay in tune (as much as I can) with where discussions are going when it comes to encryption and API operations. Much of it doesn't apply to the average API provider&nbsp;but requiring encryption for API calls, and emailing your developers when and if you do begin enforcing, is what I'd consider an essential building block for all API providers.</p>
<p>I'll keep crafting a unique blog post each time I receive on of these emails from the APIs I depend on. Hopefully some day soon, all APIs will be SSL by default.</p>
