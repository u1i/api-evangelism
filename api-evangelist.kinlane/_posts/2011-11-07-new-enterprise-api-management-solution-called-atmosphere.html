<p>I first reported on service oriented architecture (SOA) pioneer <a href="http://www.soa.com/">SOA Software&rsquo;s</a> entry into the API management arena <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/06/17/atmosphere-a-new-api-management-portal/">back in June</a>, today at the Cloud Computing Expo in Santa Clara, CA they are announcing the beta release of their enterprise API management solution called <a title="Atmosphere API Management" href="http://atmos.phe.re/">Atmos.phe.re</a>.</p>
<p>SOA has taken their enterprise API management solution, and bundled it with many of the features we are growing accustomed to within open API ecosystems, and deployed as a new solution with a focus on community.</p>
<p>The new platform intends to bring together API owners and application developers into a community, providing a central place where an ecosystem can grow around each of your APIs, whether its a private or public initiative.</p>
<p>Atmosphere is taking the social aspects of popular, open API ecosystems, and are applying these concepts to the enterprise, providing not only a place where API owners and developers can come together, but it also invites business, marketing and creative folks to get involved--creating a truly collaborative, enterprise environment around any API initiative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enterprises now have a choice in how they provide APIs. They can use Atmosphere Cloud to manage their developer community, and process messages on-premise.&rdquo; said Alistair Farquharson, Chief Technology Officer, SOA Software. &ldquo;This provides companies with complete control over their API traffic without requiring a large internal infrastructure to support their developer community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This evolution of the API ecosystem makes sense, by providing the same set of social features available within both public and private communities as well as on-premise or cloud deployments it provides a very agile, business development environment for enterprises to take advantage of.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t had a full test drive of SOA&rsquo;s new platform, but from what I&rsquo;ve seen it posseses all the characteristics I&rsquo;ve seen with other API management providers, but also brings to the table important social and community layers that I think are essential to the future of APIs.</p>
