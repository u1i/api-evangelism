<p><a title="SlashDB" href="http://www.slashdb.com/">SlashDB</a> aka /db, has recently been added to the Amazon Marketplace, providing a <a title="complete database to API solution as an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)" href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B00FFKW0GC/ref=vdr_rf#product-details">complete database to API solution as an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)</a>.</p>
<p>Companies can use the /db Amazon image to automatically <a title="generate REST APIs from common relational databases" href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/03/18/database-to-api-with-slashdb/">generate REST APIs from common relational databases</a> like Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, PostGreSQL, which includes Amazon RDS.</p>
<p>/db charges based upon the number of databases you launch and the number of users that are using the API for the database, and you will have to pay for the regular charges for any Amazon EC2 instances.</p>
<p>I like the idea of building API solutions and launching as Amazon Machine Images. I think ready-to-go platform solutions like this for AWS, Google, Heroku and other top cloud platforms are good for potential API providers.</p>
