<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/AWS_LOGO_CMYK.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />I am taking some time and writing down my image management strategy to share with <a href="http://www.audreywatters.com" target="_blank">Audrey</a>.  I have a specific process and set of tools I use to manage images I use across my <a href="http://www.kinlane.com" target="_blank">Kin Lane Blog</a>, <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">API Evangelist Blog</a> and my Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook and other online properties.<p></p>
I store all my images centrally at <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/amazon/amazon-s3/">Amazon S3</a>.  This may not be an ideal solution for everyone, but it works for me.  Its a complete storage area for all my images, audio, video and other documents.<p></p>
I use a combination of <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon Console</a>, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3247/" target="_blank">S3Fox for Firefox</a>, <a href="http://cyberduck.ch/" target="_blank">Cyberduck</a> and <a href="https://www.jungledisk.com/" target="_blank">Jungle Disk</a> to manage my Amazon S3 files.  No time to explain the madness, it just works.<p></p>
I have a central bucket at Amazon S3 for storing ALL images I need to support my public online properties.   I have set a bucket policy for this bucket enforcing that all objects within are automatically publicly available.  This saves me time in having to set the ACL for each object.<p></p>
When I have a screenshot or creative commons image that I have found that I need to use in my blog I download, crop, resize, download and rename.    Then I immediately upload to my Amazon S3 public bucket, and then copy the location to my clipboard.<p></p>
With the URL of the image on Amazon S3 I go back to Wordpress and paste the URL in my blog content as an image.<p></p>
Amazon S3 in conjunction with S3Fox, Cyberduck, Jungle Disk and this process allows me to store ALL images I need for my public work in a central location that I own.<p></p>
My Amazon Web Services account is the center of my cloud storage world.  It is important that I store all my vital files here.  In the future I know where to find them and won't lost any valuable images I've used in content I have created.
