<p>I just finished going through my <a href="http://theapistack.com/">API Stack</a>, taking a fresh look at each API provider, and recording some information about each of the providers in my API monitoring system. When I started looking through my stack a couple days ago there was 830 companies listed, and after this pass through I carved the stack down to 690--why?</p>
<p><strong>APIs Go Away</strong><br /> It is a fact of life, APIs go away. I'm always amazed at how quickly an API will disappear or just fall into disrepair. I don&rsquo;t have time to assess what exactly has happened to all APIs, but if I get 404s, or can't find signs of an API program in 10 seconds, and a quick Google search, I pull them from the stack. I've noticed many start-ups seem to be coming out with a slick mobile app + API, and then a few months later the API seems to disappear. I'll start tracking on things better, and see if I can&rsquo;t produce some better examples to discuss this in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Raising The Bar</strong><br /> As I look at hundreds of APIs, and try to get familiar with them, I can't help but get frustrated by certain things, something that inevitably raises the bar of what I include in my API stack, all along the way. Sometimes I'll notice an API is actually a SOAP web service, or after playing with I find it very difficult to navigate, on-board, and actually put to use. Whatever the reasons I will remove some companies from the stack, and while I will still be keeping an eye on what they are doing (or not doing), the API is not something I'm looking to shine a light on as part of my stack.</p>
<p><strong>Hiding The Docs</strong><br /> One thing I feel like I keep coming across as I look through APIs, are companies pulling back their API documentation. As with APIs going away, I don't always have details about what types of documentation were available historically (something that is changing), so it is hard to tell if an API had docs, then moved them behind a password protected area. Regardless, if I can&rsquo;t learn about an API, without registering for yet another account, you aren't in the stack. I will not be requesting access, signing up for, or begging you for the opportunity to learn about, and showcase your API.</p>
<p><strong>API Is A Priority</strong><br /> Your API is not a &ldquo;support entry&rdquo;, or &ldquo;advanced feature&rdquo;. Your API is the next step in the evolution of your companies online presence. While I may still showcase some seemingly dysfunctional APIs, usually there is other value present there, otherwise I wouldn't be highlighting a company's effort. If your API is buried deep within your CMS, or barely a footnote in your online presence, it is likely I won't be talking about it. You can tell sites where APIs are a priority, because they have portals available at http://developer.example.com, modern API documentation, simple sub-domains like http://api.example.com for their APIs, and a link to APIs in the header or footer navigation for a site.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure my API Stack will grow and shrink over time, and new APIs will come, and others will mature and be put back into the stack. Right now <a href="http://theapistack.com">the API Stack is just a list of 690 companies doing interesting things with APIs</a>, and some basic details, with links to their efforts. I&rsquo;m working to better defining the over 100 business categories these companies exist in, as well as better define each API resource they possess, and I'm looking to continue providing a better defined API stack.</p>
<p>In 2014 when it comes to APIs I&rdquo;m a little more focused on quality, than quantity.</p>
