<p>It has been a while since I provided an update on the White House Digital Strategy. &nbsp;I <a href="/federal_government.php">monitor the progress of federal agencies participation programmatically</a>, using JSON reports published by each agency at the agencies domain, /digitalstrategy.</p>
<p>After running the script today, I notice 20 federal agencies with active footprints. &nbsp;There are about five more, but there are issues with the JSON version of their digital stratgies--I really want to focus on the programmatic value. So, across these 20 agencies I find 76 data API initiatives&nbsp;and 75 mobile API projects.</p>
<p>To bring you up to speed, there are two specific milestones in the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government-strategy.pdf">Digital Government Strategy</a> that specifically address API deployment:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>2.2 (Data) -</strong> Make high-value data and content in at least existing two major customer-facing systems available through web APIs, apply metadata tagging and publish a plan to transition additional high-value systems</li>
<li><strong>7.2 (Mobile) -</strong> Optimize at least two existing priority customer-facing services for mobile use and publish a plan for improving additional existing services&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>To help shed light on where these progressive agencies are going with both their data and mobile intiatives I wanted to break them out into separate groups, for each agency.</p>

<li> <strong>ATF Trace Data Report</strong> - A key component of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives&rsquo; (ATF) enforcement mission is the tracing of firearms on behalf of thousands of Federal, State, local and foreign law enforcement agencies. Firearms trace data is critically important information developed by ATF. ATF has prepared the following state-by-state reports utilizing trace data which is intended to provide the public with insight into firearms recoveries. </li>
<li> <strong>National Sex Offender Website and Database</strong> - The Dru Sjodin National Sex Offender Public Website (NSOPW), coordinated by the U.S. Department of Justice, is a cooperative effort between jurisdictions hosting public sex offender registries (&ldquo;Jurisdictions&rdquo;) and the federal government and is offered free of charge to the public. These Jurisdictions include the 50 states, U.S. Territories, the District of Columbia, and participating tribes. The Website provides an advanced search tool that allows a user to submit a single national query to obtain information about sex offenders; a listing of public registry Web sites by state, territory, and tribe; and information on sexual abuse education and prevention. </li>
<li> <strong>FOIA.gov</strong> - FOIA.gov houses annual Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) data from all agencies subject to the FOIA. This data is collected annually and available to the public as PDF reports or in various machine-readable formats on FOIA.gov. </li>
<li> <strong>Uniform Crime Report</strong> - The Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program was conceived in 1929 by the International Association of Chiefs of Police to meet a need for reliable, uniform crime statistics for the nation. In 1930, the FBI was tasked with collecting, publishing, and archiving those statistics. Today, several annual statistical publications are produced from data provided by nearly 17,000 law enforcement agencies across the United States. </li>
<li> <strong>National Crime Victimization Survey</strong> - NCVS is the Nation's primary source of information on criminal victimization. Each year, data are obtained from a nationally representative sample of about 40,000 households comprising nearly 75,000 persons on the frequency, characteristics and consequences of criminal victimization in the United States. Each household is interviewed twice during the year. The survey enables BJS to estimate the likelihood of victimization by rape, sexual assault, robbery, assault, theft, household burglary, and motor vehicle theft for the population as a whole as well as for segments of the population such as women, the elderly, members of various racial groups, city dwellers, or other groups. The NCVS provides the largest national forum for victims to describe the impact of crime and characteristics of violent offenders. </li>

Not only do federal employees use this information whenever there is bad weather or an unexpected major event such as an earthquake, but local businesses and other organizations often make their own operating status decisions based on the federal government&rsquo;s decision. Although OPM has never created an application for the operating status, one exists for iOS devices and is sold by a private entity for $0.99. We will make this freely available information also more freely accessible with a mobile application for both iOS and Android devices. </li>
