<p>I'm continuing my journey through the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/schedule.php">session line-up at API Strategy &amp; Practice next week in Amsterdam</a>, next up is the API discovery and trust session, where the conversation will be about API directories, service descriptions and of trust and rating systems for APIs.</p>

<p>It will be tough to decide between the API design and development and this one in the first session, on Day 1 for me. Thankfully that everything is recorded!</p>
<p><a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com/">API discovery</a> is an area we have a lot of work to do to prepare for the explosive growth in the space. It is tough to find quality APIs, understand the differences between APIs, and know who you can really depend on after you&rsquo;ve integrated into your applications.  This will be an important session.</p>
