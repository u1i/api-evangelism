<p>I&rsquo;m adding the <a href="http://apiratings.org/">API Rating Agency</a> to my stack of companies who deliver in the area of <a title="API discovery" href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com/">API discovery</a>.  The API Rating Agency helps API consumers understand each API provider on a whole list of metrics, ranging from terms of service to platform uptime.</p>
<p>Rating of APIs has been a nut I&rsquo;ve been trying to crack for a couple years now, resulting in a ranking system that is more human, than algorithm&mdash;so I know how hard  it is to go through hundreds of APIs, and develop some sort of coherent ranking system.</p>
<p>The API Rating Agency is a work in progress. I know they are hard at work reviewing API providers, so if you have an API make sure and contact them and see how you can put together a package that will help them understand your API.</p>
<p>To achieve the scale we need in the API economy, we will have to have an unbiased, 3rd party ranking, kind of sorta like Moody&rsquo;s or Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s, but hopefully more neutral. Developers have to be able to understand which platforms they can depend on.</p>
<p>You can catch Jonathan Bourguignon (<a href="https://twitter.com/jon_bou">@jon_bou</a>) of the API Rating Agency at <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/schedule.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice next week in Amsterdam</a>, participating in the discovery and trust session&mdash;I hope to see you there!</p>
