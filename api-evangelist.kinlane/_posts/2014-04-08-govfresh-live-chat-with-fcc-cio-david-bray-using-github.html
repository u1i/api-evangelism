<p>I stumbled into a pretty interesting use of Github yesterday, which I&rsquo;m seeing as part of a greater push from our government to use the popoular social coding platform. The government blog <a href="http://govfresh.com/">Govfresh</a> held a live chat session with FCC CIO David Bray (<a href="https://twitter.com/fcc_cio">@fcc_cio</a>), where some really interesting questions were asked of the very progressive CIO.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to break up a few of the questions into separate blog posts, what I wanted to highlight in this post was the use of Github as a chat forum, showing once again that the platform isn&rsquo;t just about managing code, but can be used to openly manage a multitude of collaborative government technical operations.</p>
<p>Luke Fretwell (<a href="https://twitter.com/lukefretwell">@lukefretwell</a>) opened up the discussion which ran for about an hour, asking Bray several questions, and then Steve Spiker (<a href="https://twitter.com/spjika">@spjika</a>), myself and the infamous Alex Howard (<a href="https://twitter.com/digiphile">@digiphile)</a> chimed in with further questions&mdash;making for a pretty interesting discussion.</p>
<p>Govfresh used <a href="https://github.com/gitrun/chat">Gitchat</a>, a way of turning Github Issue Management + Github APIs into a chat thread, for the conversation. I like this approach to managing and controlling a live conversation, with the ability to archive for future use. I think it is also a great way to help people in government understand that Github is more than just code, it is also about being very social and collaborative around technical ideas.</p>
