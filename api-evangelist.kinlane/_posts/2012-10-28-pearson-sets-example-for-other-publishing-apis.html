<p>One API I&rsquo;ve been watching grow and evolve from day one is the <a title="Pearson Developer Community" href="http://developer.pearson.com/">Pearson Developer Community</a>.  I first wrote about them when Peasron <a title="announced a new initiative to build an API platform that give developers access to the publisher's content" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/10/pearson-plans-api-platform-to-unlock-content/">announced a new initiative to build an API platform that give developers access to the publisher's content</a> in May of 2011.  Then in <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/08/16/re-inventing-pearson-publishing-using-apis/">August 2011 they launched three APIs</a>:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/longman-dictionary/apimethod/get-entry-0/189/overview">Longman Dictionary</a></strong> - The Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English is the flagship Longman dictionary</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/ft-press/apimethod/get-book-block/189/overview">FT Press</a></strong> - FT Press provides essential insights from the best business books and original writings by leading business thinkers</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/eyewitness-guides/apimethod/entries-guide/189/overview">Eyewitness Guides</a> </strong>- The DK Eyewitness Travel Guides show you what others only tell you</li>
</ul>
<p>After Pearson got acquainted with the ins and outs of API evangelism, and supporting the Pearson developer community, they <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/06/18/launching-apis-one-book-at-a-time/">released two more APIs</a> this year:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/pearson-kitchen-manager/apimethod/courses/190/overview">Pearson Kitchen Manager</a> </strong>- Pearson Kitchen Manager is a valuable resource for food enthusiasts and chefs alike, featuring a vast collection of recipes from bestselling Pearson textbooks of top culinary schools</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/nursing-health-survival-guides-api/apimethod/get-article/189/overview">Nursing &amp; Health Survival Guides API</a> </strong>- The best-selling Pearson Nursing &amp; Health Survival Guide series is the UK's premier quick reference, aide memoire support for health and social care students and professionals while in practice and studying</li>
</ul>
<p>It looks like Pearson is really finding a rhythm with identifying content to make available, as well as the right approach to deploying as APIs. They have 3 more high value publishing APIs available:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/penguin-classics-api/apimethod/get-article-1/189/overview">Penguin Classics API </a></strong>- The Penguin English Library is a collection of 100 of the best novels ever written in the English Language. Classics like Jane Eyre, Dracula and Great Expectations </li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/dkimages-api/apimethod/list-images/189/overview">dkimages API</a> </strong>- The dkimages API is an encyclopaedic collection of 90,000 high-resolution images</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/peachpit-visual-quickstart-guides-api/apimethod/get-article-0/190/overview">Peachpit Visual QuickStart Guides API</a></strong> - With more than 12 million copies in print, Visual QuickStart Guides have been a vital part of the computer book category for years</li>
</ul>
<p>That is a total of 8 APIs endpoints Pearson has made available via their developer center--providing some valuable text and image content that developers can use to build web and mobile apps.</p>
<p>What impresses me with Pearson is that they&rsquo;ve found an efficient way to identify valuable assets within legacy inventory, part them out and expose these valuable parts and pieces as APIs.  Essentially giving them a new life--driving web, mobile and tablet applications.</p>
<p>Pearson has deployed their developer center with all the <a title="essential API building blocks" href="/the_building_blocks_of_a_successful_api.php">essential API building blocks</a>, while also executing an efficient API evangelism campaign around their APis, and delivering value to developers.  It&rsquo;s a commendable operation for such a big publisher.</p>
<p>If you are interested in hearing more about what Pearson is up to with their APIs, you can catch them at the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference this week in NYC</a>.  Pearson will be presenting as part of a media API session as well as helping sponsor the event, to make sure we can all get together an have these conversations.</p>
