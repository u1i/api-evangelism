<p>A new way that I am discovering the new tech services that the cool kids are using is from the dedicated integrations pages of API service providers I track on. Showcasing the services your platform integrates with is a great way of educating consumers about what the possibilities are when it comes to your tools and services. It is also a great way for analysts like me to connect the dots around which services are most important to the average user.</p>
<p>API service providers like <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/product/integrations/">DataDog</a>, <a href="https://www.opsclarity.com/product/integrations/">OpsClarity</a>,&nbsp;and <a href="https://pingometer.com/integrations/">Pingometer</a>&nbsp;are providing dedicated integration pages showcasing the other 3rd party platforms they integrate with. Alpha API dogs like Runscope also have <a href="https://www.runscope.com/docs/api/integrations">integration APIs</a>, allowing you to get a list of integrations your team depends on (perfect for another story). I'm just getting going tracking on tracking the existence of these integration pages, but each time I have come across one lately I find myself stopping and looking through each of the services included.</p>
<p>Directly, API integrations provide a great way to inform customers about which of the other services they use can be integrated with this platform, potentially adding to the number of reasons why they might choose to go with a service. Indirectly, API integration pages provide a great way to inform the sector about which API driven platforms are important to service providers, and their customers. After I get a number of these integration pages bookmarked as part of my research, I will work on other stories showcasing the various approaches I find.</p>
