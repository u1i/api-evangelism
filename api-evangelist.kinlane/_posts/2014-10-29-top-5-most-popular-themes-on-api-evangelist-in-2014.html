<p>Throughout 2014, when I look at the top 10 posts in my Google Analytics dashboard each month, there has been a consistent theme of what stories are driving page views. The concept of a page is only one metric I look at when evaluating where the API space might be going, and while I don&rsquo;t write stories specifically to page views, they do provide me with a general barometer of what my readers are interested in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing give areas consistently generating the most views across the API Evangelist Network:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Internal APIs - </strong>This slot is pretty much dominated by <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">The Secret To Amazons Success Is Internal</a> story getting thousands of page view each month, even with being written back in January of 2012.</li>
<li><strong>Single Page App Tooling - </strong>Simple, easy to use formable single page apps like my <a href="http://csv-converter.publicprivatesector.org/">CSV Converter</a>, and my <a href="http://data.ongithub.com/">Data.Ongithub.com</a> produce some really long lasting traffic, providing value to users.</li>
<li><strong>API Design - </strong>This is definitely the topic of 2014, with all of my stories talking about <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design</a> tools like Swagger and API Blueprint dominating the top 10.</li>
<li><strong>Hypermedia - </strong>Its time has come in 2014, and hypermedia stories like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/15/what-are-some-good-examples-of-hypermedia-apis/">What Are Some Examples of Hypermedia APIs</a> are popular with developers, and non-developers when it comes to understand what hypermedia is all about.</li>
<li><strong>API Roundups -</strong> A pretty proven formula of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/26/payment-apis-that-i-am-watching/">rounding up listings of APIs for a specific purpose</a>, the only difference is when I do it, I personally look at each API and make sure there is something there, defining what I consider to be <a href="http://payments.apievangelist.com">API stacks or collections.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ll revisit this at the end of the year and see if it still stands up. For me it provides some sort of map of where my readers heads are at, and by no means is any measurement of where the API space is going, but is at least a place to start thinking about what is on people&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>I usually don&rsquo;t spend much time looking at metrics across my platform, but I see a lot of interesting trends, and I like being a transparent layer for the API space, so I think i will try to better track on some patterns I&rsquo;m seeing in my own network, as well as across the space, and share as stories here on the blog.</p>
