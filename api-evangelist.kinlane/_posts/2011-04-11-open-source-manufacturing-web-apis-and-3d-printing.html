<p>I just finished reading, <a title="Will 3-D Printing End Mass Manufacturing" href="http://mashable.com/2011/04/10/3d-printing-pics/">Will 3-D Printing End Mass Manufacturing</a>, on Mashable.</p>
<p>I also had a link to an <a title="open source manufacturing" href="http://p2pfoundation.net/Open_Source_Manufacturing_Tools">open source manufacturing</a> site bookmarked from a couple months ago.</p>
<p>And of course I live and breathe <a title="Web APIs" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/">Web APIs</a> on a daily basis.</p>
<p>So after reading all this, my mind starts thinking about open source manufacturing processes bundled with open web APIs, and the future of 3-D printing and / or manufacturing.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Open Source Manufacturing" href="http://p2pfoundation.net/Open_Source_Manufacturing_Tools">Open Source Manufacturing</a></strong> - Open source manufacturing lets you download hardware, blue-prints, and instructions for any potential manufacturing process.</li>
<li><strong><a title="Web APIs" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com">Web-APIs</a></strong> - An interface that allows application developers to build on top of data or another application.</li>
<li><strong><a title="3-D Printing" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing">3-D Printing</a></strong> -3D printing is a form of additive manufacturing technology where a three dimensional object is created by laying down successive layers of material.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you start thinking of this in terms of local, cottage style manufacturing, I can see lots ofpossibilities.</p>
<p>Imagine, a group of people in a small town, research a need for a component or product. Buy a 3-D Printer, register it with a open API manufacturing network (say based on <a title="Google Cloud Print" href="http://code.google.com/apis/cloudprint/docs/proxyinterfaces.html">Google Cloud Print</a>). Now they can take orders in real-time over the Internet.</p>
