<p>API calls and passing on cloud storage costs are the most common ways to approach BaaS pricing. &nbsp;But beyond these two areas, there are numerous other ways BaaS providers are pricing BaaS services for developers.</p>
<p>With mobile app users being the center of the world in mobile app development, it makes a per user charge charge for BaaS services seem logical. A per user fee, potentially couples a BaaS provider monetization strategy with their developers. &nbsp;In this approach a provider may assume their developers will be monetization each end-user of their platform, thus can afford to pay more as they add users.</p>
<p>Other BaaS providers state that charging developers based upon API calls and number of active uses results in a kind of success tax. &nbsp;Meaning the more successful your app is, the more active users and API calls you will have, equally a significantly larger BaaS bill. &nbsp;There is still a lot of open discussion around this point.</p>
<p>BaaS pricing is far from standardized. &nbsp;It is much more a reflection of the IaaS layer beneath the BaaS providers than it is about the end users of the platforms. However there is a lot of experimentation going on in Baas, resulting in numerous other approaches to pricing across 45 BaaS providers.</p>
