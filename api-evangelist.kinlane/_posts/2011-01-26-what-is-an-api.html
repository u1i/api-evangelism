<img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/tag-cloud-api.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" />An <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">Application Programming Interface</a> (API) is a way for websites, programs, and <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/mobile/">mobile</a> applications to talk to each other.<p></p>
APIs allow access to information, provide functionality or control electronic gadgets.<p></p>
Companies develop APIs to allow partners and other developers access their information, services and hardware.<p></p>
APIs come in many shapes and size.   The most common type of <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">API</a> today is known as <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/definition-rest.php">REST</a>.   REST works just like any other web site on the Internet.<p></p>
Whereas people interact with computers via programs, websites, and mobile applications, those programs, web sites, and mobile applications interact with each other via APIs.<p></p>
Every time you use your credit card, an API is used. When you visit a website, it often gets information and delivers its functionality through APIs, such as the latest articles from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/" target="_blank">NY Times</a>.  Mobile apps on your phone use APIs.<p></p>
APIs are all around you.  You just don't see them.
