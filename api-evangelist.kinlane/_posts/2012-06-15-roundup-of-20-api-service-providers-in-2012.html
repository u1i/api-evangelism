<p>Its been over six months since I did my <a title="roundup of 11 API service providers on ProgrammableWeb" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/10/19/api-service-provider-roundup/">roundup of 11 API service providers on ProgrammableWeb</a>. &nbsp;I've been seeing enough new entries into the space, I think its time to do another roundup, providing a single list of API service providers for you to explore.</p>
<p>I will start with I called the grandfathers of the space. &nbsp;The ones who were doing it before APIs became all cool.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.soa.com/atmosphere"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/atmosphere-logo-1.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a><strong><a href="http://www.soa.com/atmosphere">Atmosphere</a></strong>&nbsp;- The SOA Software, Atmosphere&trade; provides a secure, robust platform that companies can use to share their APIs with the developer community of their choice.

<p>After my post in October of 2011, two other providers came out of the woodwork and said, "Hey! what about us? &nbsp;We've been doing this a while too!" &nbsp;So I have to include them this time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/REST-Web-Services-API-Security/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/intel_logo_500.jpg" alt="" width="100" align="right" /></a><strong><a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/REST-Web-Services-API-Security/">Intel</a></strong>&nbsp;- Intel&reg; Expressway Service Gateway provides an enforcement point for REST web services messages and can delegate authentication and authorization to identity management and PKI systems such as Active Directory and CA* Siteminder.

</blockquote>
<p>Then there are the three major players in API management, that have been dominating the current landscape:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.3scale.net/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/3scale-logo.jpg" alt="" width="190" align="right" /></a><strong><a href="http://www.3scale.net/">3Scale</a></strong>&nbsp;- 3scale provides an Out-of-the-Box Cloud API management Platform &amp; Infrastructure for developers, and companies to securely open, control, manage, operate and monetize their API to 3rd parties (e.g. developers, business partners, etc). 3scale API management platform is Plug and Play, configurable, flexible and scalable and brings API providers an unparalleled level of ownership, control and configuration to ensure QoS, SLA and a great user experience.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I left one provider out of my last service provider round-up, which is ironic, since the post was on <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/">ProgrammableWeb</a>, which is owned by Alcatel-Lucent:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/open-api-platform/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/alcatel-lucent-logo.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a><strong><a href="http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/open-api-platform/">Alcatel-Lucent</a></strong>&nbsp;- The Alcatel-Lucent Open API Platform (OAP) is an API Monetization and Optimization software solution, for Service Providers to turn their data and telecommunication infrastructure into a commercial transaction platform.

</blockquote>
<p>Next there are several companies focused on APIs for your data. &nbsp;Last year I included <a title="InfoChimps" href="http://www.infochimps.com/">InfoChimps</a>, which has pivoted since then and is more a big data platform now. &nbsp;I'm going to go ahead and bundle Socrata in with the remaning data API providers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://kasabi.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/Kasabi-Logo.png" alt="" width="130" align="right" /></a><strong><a href="http://kasabi.com/">Kasabi</a></strong>&nbsp;- Kasabi is a marketplace for people publishing and looking for data.

<p>During the last post I had showcased two new players in the space:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.mashape.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/mashape-logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a><strong><a href="http://www.mashape.com/">Mashape</a></strong>&nbsp;- Mashape provides tools that enable developers to quickly deliver and consume APIs and offers a marketplace for listing APIs.

<p><a href="http://apiary.io/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/apiary-io-logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a><strong><a href="http://apiary.io/">Apiary.io</a>&nbsp;</strong>- Apiary.io provides developers with a way to describe APIs using whats called an API Blueprint-a custom language that allows you to rapidly describe you API in a way that you can collaborate/version/merge as you're used to when coding. From this blueprint Apiary.io then generate API documentation, a debugging proxy and bug reports. Apiary.io also provides social and technical integration using Github, to integrate with where you are already deploying your code and collaborating with developers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While Apiary.io was still in early beta, Mashape was open for business and is now out of beta. Now, in the first six months of 2012 I've tracked on seven new players in the space:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://apiaxle.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/api-axle-logo.png" alt="" width="75" align="right" /></a><strong><a href="http://apiaxle.com/">API Axle</a></strong>&nbsp;- Apiaxle is a free, locally hosted API proxy that can sit infront of your API, providing key authentication, rate limiting and statics.

<p>That brings a total of API service providers to 20. &nbsp;There are other providers that deliver services API owners can use, but the companies I've included are focusing specifically on providing services to API owners, and a growing focus on delivering services just for developers.</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/webshell-logo.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm in talks with several other new providers as well, who aren't quite ready at the time of this post. &nbsp;One such company is&nbsp;<a title="Webshell" href="http://webshell.io/home">Webshell</a>, who is developing a scripting language designed for fast API consumption and implementation. After a demo I think Webshell could open up new ways for us to consume, not just single APIs, but many APIs mashed up together creating entirely new API interfaces and interactions.</p>
<p>Any way you look at there is serious API innovation going on in 2012, its an exciting area to be part of. &nbsp;If you know of any API service providers I missed, make sure and drop me a line.&nbsp;</p>
