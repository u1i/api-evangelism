<p></p>While considering this, I keep having thoughts about the perfect API stack. In my opinion, these are APIs that do one thing and do it well, makes a developers life easier, and have clear business value.
<p></p>The first one that comes to mind is <a title="Twilio" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/api-detail.php?API_ID=1823">Twilio</a>. When I think of Twilio, I think of two clear use cases: voice and SMS.
<p></p>Voice and SMS are two critical tools to have in your developer toolbox. These are services that have clear value, that would take a lot of effort to duplicate yourself, making it a no brainer to pay for as a service.
<p></p>In an effort to define the perfect API stack, I'm going to start blogging about APIs that fall into this category as I find them. They will be short posts that introduce you to these services, and when I get enough I will launch a landing page showcasing the perfect API stack.
