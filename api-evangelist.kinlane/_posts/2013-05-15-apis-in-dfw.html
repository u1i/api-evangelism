<p><a title="DFW API Professional Meetup Group" href="http://www.meetup.com/DFW-API-Professionals/events/115600132/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/dfw-api-meetup-group/dfw-api-meetup-group.jpeg" border="0" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I just got back from the Dallas-Fort Worth area. I visited Dallas last night to help kick off the first gathering of the DFW API Professionals Meetup.</p>
<p>We got together at Microsoft around 6PM and I talked from 6:30 until 8:00, evolving on my <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/talks/api-meetup-dallas-tx/web-to-programmableweb-to-programmableworld/index.html#/" target="_blank">From Web, to ProgrammableWeb to ProgrammableWorld</a> talk.</p>
<p><a title="TheRightAPI" href="http://www.therightapi.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/therightapi-logo-2.png" border="0" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The meetup was about 45 people ranging from developers to investors.  I showed up with a lot of content, but I wanted to make sure and cover the full API spectrum, while also introducing some new content about specifically about API consumption.</p>
<p>During the event I had some time to get to know the <a href="http://www.therightapi.com/">theRightAPI</a>, <a title="BAaS" href="http://www.proxomo.com/">Proxomo</a><span>,&nbsp;</span><a title="API Management" href="http://www.layer7tech.com/">Layer 7 Technologies</a>&nbsp;<span>and&nbsp;</span><a title="Tech Efficiency and Innovation" href="http://www.parivedasolutions.com/">Pariveda Solutions</a> folks--while connecting with the rest of the meet up group members.</p>
<p><a title="AT&amp;T Foundry" href="https://www.foundry.att.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/att/att-foundry.png" border="0" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Then, this morning theRightAPI crew brought me out to Plano, TX to the <a title="AT&amp;T Foundry" href="https://www.foundry.att.com/">AT&amp;T Foundry</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/attfoundry">@attfoundry</a>), where I got to talk with Vincent Button (<a href="https://twitter.com/vebutton">@vebutton</a>) and Jennifer Conley (<a href="https://twitter.com/jenniferconley">@jenniferconley</a>).  I was a little blown away by what I saw.  It wasn't what I was used when visiting the campuses of big telco companies in the past.  The facility was something you associate with Silicon Valley and Bay Area. Open layout with a variety of people working on things ranging from voice solutions to the internet of things.</p>
<p><a title="Gravity Center" href="http://gravitycentredallas.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/gravity-center/gravity-center-logo.png" border="0" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Afterwards, Jennifer walked us up to the <a title="Gravity Center" href="http://gravitycentredallas.com/">Gravity Center</a>, which has been provided access to AT&amp;T and Alcatel-Lucent resources to support multiple startups in the North Texas area.  I got to meet to the <a title="Bookshout" href="http://bookshout.com/">BookShout</a> team and hear about how they are navigating and working to change the book publishing space, while allowing people to discover books, and build social networks around books and authors.</p>
<p><a title="Bookshout" href="http://bookshout.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/bookshout/bookshout-logo.png" border="0" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm pretty impressed with what I saw in Texas in the last 48 hours.  I met some pretty tech savvy people building interesting startups, putting APIs to use in meaningful ways, and a community around them that is investing in what they are doing. While I was there, I saw all the same elements for startup success I see in Silicon Valley, but without much of the hype.</p>
<p>I was stoked to be able to help kick off the DFW API Professionals Meetup Group.  I appreciate theRightAPI for bringing me out, and  Proxomo, Layer 7 and Pariveda Solutions for making it happen.</p>
