<a href="http://rdio.com"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Rdio-Logo-Gradient.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>I'm starting to see more API providers working together to attract developers to their platforms.<p></p>
As an API Evangelist I look for other APIs that enhance the <a title="Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API" href="http://developer.mimeo.com">Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API</a>, and try to figure out how I can leverage this, or at least tell the story.<p></p>
<a title="Google Cloud Print Services Interface" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/02/google-cloud-print-proxy-cloud-printer/">Google Cloud Print Services Interface</a> and the <a title="Box.net" href="http://www.box.net">Box.net</a> API have been two of my favorites so far. I also just finished a blog post about <a title="creating classroom and training materials with Crocodoc and Mimeo Connect" href="http://developer.mimeo.com/blog/blog_detail.php?ID=99">creating classroom training materials with Crocodoc and Mimeo Connect</a>.<p></p>
Today I saw that<a href="http://rdio.com">Rdio</a>, the social music service <a title="announce their partnership" href="http://blog.rdio.com/post/5161479190/announcing-rdios-partnership-with-the-echo-nest">announce their partnership</a> with <a title="The Echo Nest" href="http://the.echonest.com/">The Echo Nest</a>, a music intelligence platform.<p></p>
They are partnering behind the scenes, but I'm sure the API is the driving force behind this relationship.<a title="The Echo Nest" href="http://the.echonest.com/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/the-echo-nest.gif" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a><p></p>
APIs enable new types of partnerships, and even allow API providers to work together and offer a more collective value.<p></p>
What other APIs do you think compliment each other, and should consider partnering?
