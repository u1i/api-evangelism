<p>I'm adding some new BaaS features I found in a recent press release from BaaS provider <a title="AnyPresence" href="http://www.anypresence.com/">AnyPresence</a> titled, "<a href="http://www.anypresence.com/press-release/AnyPresence_Launches_4th-Generation_Mobile_Backend_as_a_Service_Platform.php">AnyPresence Launches 4th-Generation Mobile Backend-as-a-Service Platform with Unparalleled Enterprise Capabilities</a>", to my list of BaaS features. &nbsp;As I'm processing them I notice they are some pretty significant features:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Application Cloning -&nbsp;</strong>For organizations looking to build multiple apps that have common core functionality with only minor variations, this powerful feature allows them to create a copy of an existing app along with all data source, object, and user interface definitions, saving significant development effort.</li>
<li><strong>Automated App UI Testing -&nbsp;</strong>Developers who use AnyPresence to generate a starter mobile app user interface (UI), now get the added benefit of functional test scripts for native iOS, native Android, and jQuery Mobile web apps. These test scripts can be run to ensure the app is interacting with backend functionality as expected, saving time in testing and improving reliability.</li>
<li><strong>Custom Server Extensions -&nbsp;</strong>While developers have always been able to add custom code to objects within AnyPresence, they can now create re-usable &ldquo;Extensions&rdquo; that can be shared across teams or lines of business. This also enables third parties to encapsulate their services as official AnyPresence Extensions, enabling a marketplace of add-ons that can be used across the AnyPresence customer base.</li>
<li><strong>Enterprise App Store Integration -&nbsp;</strong>AnyPresence now supports the ability to deploy apps to employees directly via enterprise app stores powered by Mobile Application Management (MAM) or Mobile Device Management (MDM) vendors. Apperian EASE is first MAM partner solution to be integrated directly with the AnyPresence Designer.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud Infrastructure Management -&nbsp;</strong>For the default cloud backend server deployment to Heroku, administrators can now control the performance characteristics of their app, and choose from hundreds of Heroku add-ons, directly from the AnyPresence Designer. This seamless integration enables developers to plan for the required capacity and usage of each individual backend server instance, and manage them from one central location.</li>
</ul>
<p>It can be difficult to interpret each BaaS provider's products and services, and establish any sort of common definition, but applicaiton cloning, automated testing, custom server extensions and enterprise app stores are pretty straight-forward and powerful BaaS features.</p>
<p>I'm curious to see where AnyPresence goes with their custom extensions. &nbsp;I think whoever can do this part of BaaS correctly will win the BaaS world championships! (That is an award, right?)</p>
<p>Lot's of exciting stuff coming from the BaaS sector lately! &nbsp;Fun space to watch.</p>
