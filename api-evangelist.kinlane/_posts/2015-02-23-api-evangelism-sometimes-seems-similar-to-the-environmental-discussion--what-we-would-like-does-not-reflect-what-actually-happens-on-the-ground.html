<p>I was just listening to segment on NPR, All Things Considered, about <a href="http://www.npr.org/2015/02/16/386758778/science-standards-draw-climate-change-debate-back-into-wyo-classrooms">educating students around the environment</a>. Throughout the program I couldn&rsquo;t help be reminded of a similar imbalance in the world of APIs. Throughout my API experience I&rsquo;m constantly faced with a separation between what I hear is possible, what I would like to see, and what actually occurs on the ground in startups, small businesses, and within enterprise organizations, and government agencies.</p>
<p>You might have to <a href="http://www.npr.org/2015/02/16/386758778/science-standards-draw-climate-change-debate-back-into-wyo-classrooms">listen to the segment</a>&nbsp;to fully grasp what I mean, but essentially it comes down to this: we&rsquo;d like a perfect world where we do not negatively impact the environment, and everyone understands the urgency, but in reality there are a lot of real world constraints that prevent us from truly realizing this vision. In the world of APIs, these same constraints exist. We&rsquo;d like to achieve API harmony in everything we do, but in reality there are a lot of real world constraints we have to navigate, from knowledge and education, to the time and resources needed to implement.</p>
<p>This chasm reflects the challenge in my API Evangelist mission. How do steer clear of selling people a single product, platform, or holistic vision of an API strategy, and break things into small, bite-size chunks of information that anyone can use (or not use) as they see fit, in the environments they operate within.  I don&rsquo;t believe there is a silver bullet, or single religion to follow here, it is all about staying in tune with what is working, and what is not&mdash;then making your own decisions about what is appropriate on the ground.</p>
<p>API Evangelist was born out of my success and failures working at SAP&mdash;which was all about striking a balance between what I knew was possible, what I wanted, and what was really possible in the environment I operated in. Alright, enough pontificating, and back to understanding all of this. I guess my point is, that this isn&rsquo;t just about understanding where are going, where we&rsquo;ve been or where we are currently&mdash;it is also about actually making meaningful connections that guide us, incrementally, in the right direction.</p>
