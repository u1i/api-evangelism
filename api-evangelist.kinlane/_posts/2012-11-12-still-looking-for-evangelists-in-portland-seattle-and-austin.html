<p>I started <a title="actively looking for evangelists, advocates and ambassadors in multiple cities last week" href="/2012/11/03/evangelists-needed-in-new-york-chicago-boston-seattle-denver-austin-and-portland/">actively looking for evangelists, advocates and ambassadors in multiple cities last week</a>.&nbsp;I got a great response from quite a few folks who were already evangelizing in their communities or just curious about evangelism.</p>
<p>Even with the response <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I&rsquo;m still looking for evangelists in Portland, OR, Seattle, WA and Austin, TX</span>.</p>
<p>If you're interested in attending tech meetups and hackathons in your town and evangelizing some innovative API and developer platforms, I want to talk more.</p>
<p>I was surprised to get numerous folks contacting me in other cities around the world, saying they were open evangelism in their area.  Even though I&rsquo;m actively looking in Portland, OR, Seattle, WA and Austin, TX, I&rsquo;m still looking to add other cities to my list--so don't hesitate to reach out.</p>
