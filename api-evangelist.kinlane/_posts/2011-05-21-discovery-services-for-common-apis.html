<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/Google-APIs-Discovery-Service.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />I just wrote about the potential of<a title="open source billing and traffic control" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/open-source-api-billing-and-traffic-control/">open source API billing and traffic control</a> building blocks, if Google would open source their <a title="API Console" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-console/">Google API Console</a>, like they did with the <a title="Google API Explorer" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-explorer/">Google API Explorer</a>.<p></p>
I started bundling in thoughts on <a title="Google APIs Discovery Service" href="http://code.google.com/apis/discovery/index.html">Google APIs Discovery Service</a> into that post, but then realized it is a separate issue, needing its own blog post.<p></p>
First, Google isn't about to open source Google API Discovery Service.  They issue developers of the Google APIs Discovery Service a <a title="patent license" href="http://code.google.com/apis/discovery/patent-license.html">patent license</a>.  I couldn't find any more details tonight, but I'm assuming it puts this service in a different category than the rest.<p></p>
I wrote an <a title="overview of the Google APIs Discovery Service" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-discovery-service/">overview of Google APIs Discovery Service</a>, but essentially it is a way to discover and describe Google APIs using an API.  Think <a title="Web Application Discovery Language (WADL)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Application_Description_Language">Web Application Description Language (WADL)</a>, with a API to access, and focused only on supported Google APIs.<p></p>
As the number of web APIs grow, the need for a discovery APIs and a standard description language will only grow.  We wil see services like Google APIs Discovery Service popup within specific industries and API areas.<p></p>
You see potential for this with <a title="Mashery's API Netowrk" href="http://developer.mashery.com/apis">Mashsery's API Network,</a> and even more evidence with <a title="Mashape's Marketplace" href="http://www.mashape.com/index">Mashape's Marketplace</a>.<p></p>
There aren't many companies with the number of APIs that Google has, so you won't see any single company building an API discovery service like that.<p></p>
However, I'd like to see API discovery services for cloud computing, social media, location-based, and telcommunication APIs appear making it easier for developers to discover, build code libraries, and integrate with common APIs.
