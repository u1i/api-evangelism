<p><a href="http://blog.getpostman.com/2016/01/28/the-run-in-postman-button-for-improved-documentation/">The popular API client tool Postman just launched an embeddable "run in Postman" button</a>, that you can use to fast track integration with your API(s). Shortly after <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/19/button-to-run-this-api-in-the-http-api-client-of-my-choice/">I wrote a post about the importance of API definition driven embeddable tools for API service providers</a>, Postman contacted me and said, "hey! we are already working on that!" ;-)</p>
<p>With the latest update, when you use your Postman Client, you can generate some embeddable JavaScript, which you can then post alongside your API documentation, throughout your developer portal, or possibly anywhere on the open web. Something that could trim minutes, or even hours off the time it takes for new developers to go from discovery to integration.</p>
<p><a href="http://embeddable.apievangelist.com">Embeddable</a> tooling for APIs is nothing new, something we've seen leading providers like Twitter and Facebook employ successfully, but it is something that is fairly new for API service providers. Having a robust embeddable strategy like this one from Postman, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/27/embedding-your-language-sdks-in-your-apiary-documentation-using-apimatic/">last week's example from SDK provider APIMATIC</a>, is something all API service providers should be considering in 2016.</p>
