<p>I'm just getting started exploring the ways to use <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>&nbsp;when it comes organize my new Docker fueled, micro services stack. I&rsquo;ve been <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/01/10/use-apisjson-to-organize-my-swagger-defined-apis-running-in-docker-containers/">using APIs.son to describe each micro service</a>, as well as define the overall collection of almost 20 micro services. I&rsquo;m using the include collection, as a <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/01/28/using-apisjson-for-my-microservice-navigation-and-discovery/">navigation for the loosely coupled stack of micro-services</a>, and my friend <span>Chris Spiliotopoulos (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/chefarchitect">@chefarchitect</a><span>)</span>, has done some more work with <a href="https://github.com/chefArchitect/swagger.ed">his Swagger.ed</a>, delivering some <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> goodness that is in alignment with where I want to take all of this.</p>
<p>Adding to the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/23/i-got-swaggered-last-week-and-now-i-am-seeing-api-visualizations/">discovery and visualization work he did for Swagger</a>, Chris enabled Swagger.ed to look for valid APIs.son files as well, so when you browse to any APIs.son, like the one I have for my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master">micro services stack</a>, you see the little APIs.son search icon in the address bar.</p>
<p><a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/apis.json"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/apis-json-in-browser.png" alt="" width="90%" /></a></p>
<p>When you click on the APIs.son search icon in the address bar, you get a very cool visualization. Its pretty basic at the moment, just a visual catalog of the APIs available in the include collection of my stack, but when you connect up with the Swagger visualization work he's already done, we could have a pretty cool API catalog for managing and exploring microservices.</p>

<p>I have almost 20 micro-services listed, and Swagger.ed gives me the ability to navigate it in a very interactive way.  Whats next? We don&rsquo;t know&hellip;it is about exploration, and finding out the most meaningful way of exploring the APIs I deploy and aggregate into APIs.son collections.</p>
<p>I can see having a visual catalog of all of my API design that I collect, then deploy, and evolve them as needed for various parts of my infrastructure or for my clients, into other sub-collections? Disconnected collections? Loosely coupled collections? Not sure how tight I want things, part of <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/01/28/how-much-api-surface-area-before-it-stops-being-micro/">the micro service definition for me</a> is the size of the network connecting the services, as well as the services theselves.</p>
