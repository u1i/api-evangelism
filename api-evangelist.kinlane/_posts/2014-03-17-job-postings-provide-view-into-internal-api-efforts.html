<p>The API space has been pretty easy to monitor until recently, with most API efforts being public, but lately everything is trending is towards internal APIs, making it a lot harder to track on what some companies are up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always on the hunt for new signals I can use to track on what companies are up to when it comes to their API strategy. A signal I&rsquo;ve been using for a while, but is an increasingly important part of my monitoring, is the job posting for API architect, developer and evangelists.</p>
<p>An example of this is the posting for an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs2/view/12704834" target="_blank">API platform engineer from video collaboration platform BlueJeans</a>. We know that <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/09/18/leveraging-apis-in-the-cloud-to-make-video-conferencing-truly-ubiquitous/" target="_blank">BlueJeans gets APIs when it comes to integration</a>, but there isn&rsquo;t much public discussion about their internal API initiatives or any publicly available developer program.</p>
<p>According to the job posting <a href="http://bluejeans.com/" target="_blank">BlueJeans</a> is looking for a developer to help in, "building and scaling the API platform of our cloud application". It is pretty clear that APIs is what make the video collaboration platform operate, and I will add BlueJeans to my list of companies using APIs, just not into showcasing it publicly.</p>
<p>In the future, job postings will be just one of many signals we use to understand how companies are using Apis. I&rsquo;ll do what I can to get companies to share stories publicly about their APIs, but in some cases I don&rsquo;t think that companies are ready, and not used to talking about their operations in this way.</p>
