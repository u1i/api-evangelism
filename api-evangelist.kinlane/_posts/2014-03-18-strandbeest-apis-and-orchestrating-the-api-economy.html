<p>I'm going through the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/schedule.php">schedule for API Strategy &amp; Practice</a> next week in Amsterdam, getting intimate with each keynote, panel, and session, and their speakers.    On day one we have a keynote from Mike Amundsen (<a href="https://twitter.com/mamund">@mamund</a>), API Architect at Layer7 titled, "Self-Replication, Strandbeest, and the Game of Life What von Neumann, Jansen, and Conway can teach us about scaling the API economy&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I have not seen this talk by Mike, so I have no idea what he is planning, but I have to share an epiphany I had when I first contacted Mike about speaking at #APIStrat Amsterdam. Mike had responded to my initial email asking me what I was interested in having him talk about, which I&rsquo;m a huge fan of Mike&rsquo;s approach to storytelling, so I&rsquo;m leaving it up to him. However Mike responded with a link to <a href="http://www.strandbeest.com/">Strandbeest</a>, simply stating he would like to incorporate this into a talk.</p>
<p>As I watched Strandbeest I had a realization, this was a physical manifestation of what I envision as API driven application architecture for the API economy. Over the years I had built up visualizations in my mind of what architecture will look like when you are building applications with not 1 or 2, or 10 or 20 API, but hundreds of API driven resources, all working together in concert for a single outcome. The Strandbeest is the first physical object I've seen to come close to what i was seeing in my minds eye, and even more telling was that it was Mike Amundsen who introduced me to this object.</p>

<p>When you watch the <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">Strandbeest video</a>, imagine each tube as a single API, and each resulting "beest" as a system or application you intend to build with APIs. Imagine being an architect at this scale, orchestrating hundreds of APIs into a workflow, or series of workflows that produces a virtual "strandbeest" that doesn't just run on the beach, but operates within the API economy at a global scale.</p>
<p>Ok, I know this is pretty deep shit. I hope you can follow my groove, and see the same future. If you are like me, I&rsquo;m beside myself with anticipation of Mike&rsquo;s talk in Amsterdam. Mike is not just <span style="text-decoration: underline;">THE DOMAIN EXPERT</span> who is going to visualize architecture at this level, this far into the future--he&rsquo;s got the storytelling chops to help the rest of get up to speed, steering us towards a healthier version of the API economy.</p>
<p>I hope you are going to join us in <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/schedule.php">Amsterdam next week for API Strategy &amp; Practice</a>. The ability to not just hear stories like Mike&rsquo;s, but actually join him in a conversation about how we visualize, and ultimately orchestrate an API economy that flows like Strandbeests on the beach, is why <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale</a> and API Evangelist produce #APIStrat.</p>
