<p>Twitter just <a href="http://engineering.twitter.com/2012/05/improving-performance-on-twittercom.html">rolled back their architectural approach for Twitter.com</a> back to a server side implementation.</p>
<p>If you remember back in September of 2010, <a href="/admin/blog/twitter+eats+own+dogfood+api+evangelist">Twitter rebuilt Twitter.com to use a web application architecture</a> that pushed all of the UI rendering and logic to Javascript running in the browser and consumed the Twitter API directly.</p>
<p>Now they are "taking back control" of their front-end performance by moving the rendering back to the server.  They don't say whether they don't use the APIs at all, but I am working under the assumption that they abandoned them.</p>
<p>Twitter felt the API driven web application architecture broke new ground, offered a number of advantages, but it lacked support for various optimization techniques available only on the server.</p>
<p>I was excited to see Twitter go with the API driven approach, along other sites, like <a title="FCC Website" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/04/06/everything-should-be-an-api-says-fcc/">the FCC</a>. &nbsp;I hate to see them abandon it.</p>
<p><em><strong>What does this say about an API oriented architecture?</strong></em></p>
<p>Are we not ready?  Are there are not enough tools for optimization, or the talent to deliver the performance necessary for Internet at scale via API driven architecture? &nbsp;Or maybe there are other business reasons for stopping eating their own dog food and going back to a server side architecture?</p>
