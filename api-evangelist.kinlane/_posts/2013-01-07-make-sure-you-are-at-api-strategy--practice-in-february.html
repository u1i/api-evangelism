<p>I'm rebooting the marketing and PR for the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/" target="_blank">API Strategy &amp; Practice conference</a> after the holidayz. After finding a new date for the event on February 21st and 22nd, we've gone through the session and speaker lineup and almost the entire line-up is coming back, with a couple of new entries including a new keynote from&nbsp;Jeff Lawson of Twilio.</p>
<p>We had a whole bunch of new requests for speaker additions over the holidays, and while we tried to squeeze in where we could, with such a killer lineup and the fact that everyone was committed to the new dates, we had to decline some pretty good talks.</p>

<p>Over the next week we are going through and confirming with all registered attendees to verify they will be attending, but since the event was sold out before hurricane Sandy, I expect we will be announcing the event as sold out pretty soon.</p>
<p>The event is designed to be an intimate 2 days between 300 industry professionals in the API space. &nbsp;So I recommend if you are excited about APIs in 2013, make sure and head over to <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/" target="_blank">API Strategy &amp; Practice site</a> and register before its 100% sold out.</p>
