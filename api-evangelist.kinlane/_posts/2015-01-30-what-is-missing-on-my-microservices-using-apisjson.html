<p>I'm using <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/10/use-apisjson-to-organize-my-swagger-defined-apis-running-in-docker-containers/">APIs.json to organize my swagger defined microservices running in docker containers</a>, and using the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/28/using-apisjson-for-my-microservice-navigation-and-discovery/">machine readable API index to drive navigation between microservices organized in a single collection</a>. APIs.json provides a simple, machine readable way to index the technology, business, and political elements of each microservice I deploy.</p>
<p>As I was auditing the <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">18+ microservices I&rsquo;ve setup for my core operations</a>, I wanted to audit each one, and make sure I had included various elements in each APIs definition, like where developers can onboard, terms of service, and where to find related code samples. To accomplish this, I was able to just compare each microservice APIs.json, with a master APIs.json template I had established while planning my original microservice stack.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes it is just as important to know what is missing, right alongside what is available for all of my microservices, and <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a> is proving to be a simple way of understanding this layer of my API operation at scale.</p>
