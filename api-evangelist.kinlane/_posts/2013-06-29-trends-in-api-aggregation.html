<p>One trend in API usage I'm closely watching is the <a title="API Aggregation" href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com">aggregation of APIs by a new wave of startups</a>. As the world adopts more cloud services, the need to aggregate content across multiple APIs is growing.</p>
<p>I'm currently tracking on <a title="API Aggregation" href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com">15 API aggregators</a>, who focus on bringing together data and content in 10 areas:</p>

<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Analytics</li>
<li>Cloud Computing</li>
<li>Cloud Storage</li>
<li>Financial</li>
<li>Government</li>
<li>Invoicing</li>
<li>Messaging</li>
<li>Notifications</li>
<li>Personal</li>
<li>Social</li>
</ul>
<p>The companies I'm watching on may provide other services, such as integration or automation between cloud services.  However I focus on the aggregation of content and data, and the creation of new, aggregated APIs across multiple services.</p>
<p>Some comapnies also provide entirely new APIs with data, features and functionality that can only be uncovered by aggregating across multiple services.</p>
<p>In 2013 we will continue seeing API aggregation providers emerge, providing a new layer on top of the most popular API services that we are quickly growing dependent on.</p>
