<p>Github is really doing some cool stuff to help open data folks manage and share their data.</p>
<p>They just launched the ability to <a href="https://github.com/blog/1601-see-your-csvs" target="_blank">render data from .csv (comma-separated) and .tsv (tab-separated) files as an interactive table</a>, including headers and row numbering.  They even let you link to a specific row for sharing specific data from the file.</p>
<p>As I'm working on opening up government data, I'm pushing for agencies to use Github when publishing and sharing CSV, TSV, XML and JSON files. These kind of features really go a long way in helping me achieve my goals.</p>
<p>Make sure and also check out what Github has done around <a href="https://github.com/blog/1465-stl-file-viewing">3D models</a> and <a href="https://github.com/blog/1528-there-s-a-map-for-that">geographic data</a>, pretty cool stuff.</p>
