<p>I was doing some research on travel and transportation APIs over the last couple of weeks, and one of the developer portals I was looking at was one of the enterprise leaders in the space, the <a href="https://developer.sabre.com/">Sabre Dev Network</a>. I really like the overall implementation from Sabre, except for one thing...</p>
<p>There is no pricing page for the Sabre Dev Network. ;-( The only place you find a mention of pricing is in the <a href="https://developer.sabre.com/resources/FAQ">FAQ page</a>, where it says:</p>
<blockquote><em>"We have a number of different pricing options for our services. Whether you are a company just starting out or an established travel provider, we have pricing options that will fit your business needs.&rdquo;</em></blockquote>
<p>I understand you are a little apprehensive about sharing your pricing, or maybe you haven&rsquo;t really thought it through all the way, and just want to shake the trees and see what falls out. Whatever the reason, when it comes to APIs you should be a little more transparent about what is going on.</p>
<p>Additionally, as far along as you are with some of the other parts of your developer program, you should have a pretty robust service composition page, and a partner and certification framework for developers to work towards.</p>
<p>Other than the lack of information about what everything costs, I&rsquo;m pretty impressed with the <a href="https://developer.sabre.com/">Sabre Dev Network</a>, as a platform. I have two other stories to do around their approach, but wanted to start with the constructive criticism before I move into the praise. ;-)</p>
