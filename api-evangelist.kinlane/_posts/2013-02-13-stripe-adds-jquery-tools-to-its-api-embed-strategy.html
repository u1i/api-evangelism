<p>The payment API provider Stripe <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/jquery-payment">released a jQuery payment tool</a>, a general purpose library for building credit card forms, validating input, and formatting numbers. The library was developed to support <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/stripe-checkout">Checkout</a>, Stripe's embeddable checkout widget.</p>
<p>Simple, but extremely useful libraries like this can go a long way to introduce developers to your APIs and put valuable tools into their toolbox, that will help them be successful. &nbsp;Something that can go a long way in establishing a loyalty between you and your developer community.</p>
<p>You can find a <a href="http://stripe.github.com/jquery.payment/example/">live demo</a> of the library, as well as the <a href="https://github.com/stripe/jquery.payment">source on GitHub</a>.</p>
