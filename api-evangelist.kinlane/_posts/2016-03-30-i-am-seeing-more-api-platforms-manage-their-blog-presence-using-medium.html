<p>One thing that struck me as I wrote <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/30/best-buy-will-not-issue-api-keys-to-free-email-accounts-and-wants-to-get-to-know-your-company/">my post about Best Buy stopping issuing API keys to free email accounts</a>, was the fact that <a href="https://medium.com/best-buy-developers">Best Buy operates their developer blog on Medium</a>--something I am seeing more of. As I discover new API-centric companies via my blog, Twitter, Product Hunt, AngelList, and the many other ways I tune into the space, I'm seeing more companies operating the blog portion of their presence in this way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of voices in my head points out that this just doesn't seem like a good idea. It reminds me of hosting our blogs on Posterous. Medium doesn't let you map your domain, or sub-domain to your blog (invite only), but I'm sure is something they'll do soon. They don't have RSS, and they don't have a read API either? <em>*warning bells*</em> &nbsp;While I get the Medium thing, it seems like one of those neatly tended gardens, where as many roads out are gated off with friendly hand-painted signs.</p>
<p>However some of the other voices in my head chimed in that <a href="https://medium.com/policy/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f#.9x8qwapqq">Medium is just asking for non exclusive license to use your content</a>. They let you delete your account, and I know they are working hard on their API strategy. Also, I'm a big supporter of API providers being as scrappy as possible, as many of us have to do as much as we can with some often very non-existent budgets. <a href="https://github.com/BestBuyAPIs">Best Buy rocks it at leveraging Github</a>, Medium, Twitter, and all the channels I usually recommend. So in the end I really can't bitch about API platforms using Medium for their blog presence.</p>
<p>When you use Medium you get the network effect for your blog presence--something I'm working to understand better, and leverage more as part of my own work. I'll keep tracking on the APIs I find that use Medium for their blog presence. Right now my only complaint is simple -- THERE IS NO RSS!!! Beyond that, I'll just track on and see how it all plays out. My advice is to still to utilize a WordPress, Jekyll, Blogger, or other hosted service where you can map a subdomain to, keeping all the valuable exhaust within your domain. Then follow the <a href="https://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE">POSSE</a> principles when incorporating Medium into the communication strategy for your API platform.</p>
