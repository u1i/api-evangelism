<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/Google-APIs-Console-1.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" />I was writing a story for <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://www.programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a> tonight on the enhancements Google made recently to its API console.<p></p>
I hadn't properly covered the <a title="API Console" href="https://code.google.com/apis/console/">API Console</a>, <a title="API Explorer" href="http://code.google.com/apis/explorer/">API Explorer</a> here on <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://www.apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, so I took the time, played with more, and wrote up overviews for each.<p></p>
I noticed something while reviewing Google's recent efforts to organize their family of <a title="88 APIs" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory/1?company=Google">88 APIs</a>, and make it easier to discover, integrate, and manage for developers.<p></p>
Google is taking a similar approach to managing their APIs, as <a title="Apigee" href="http://www.apigee.com">Apigee</a>, <a title="Mashery" href="http://www.mashery.com">Mashery</a>, and <a title="3Scale" href="http://www.3Scale.net">3Scale</a> does for other API providers.<p></p>
<a title="Apigee" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/apigee-api-services/">Apigee</a>, <a title="Mashery" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/mashery-api-services/">Mashery</a>, and <a title="3Scale" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/3scale-api-services/">3Scale</a> provide a wealth of knowledge when it comes to API deployment that very few companies can touch.<p></p>
Beyond expertise, they provide a set of <a title="common building blocks every API should offer" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/07/api-area-common-building-blocks/">common building blocks every API should offer</a>.  These are tools like forums and blogs you can find elsewhere, but these API service providers deliver in a neat bundle ready to go for your API.<p></p>
But the real value they bring to the table, that you can't really find anywhere else is:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>API Billing</li>
	<li>API Traffic Controls</li>
	<li>API Metrics &amp; Analytics</li>
</ul>
And Apigee has one other piece that Mashery and 3Scale do not.  They have an <a title="API Explorer" href="http://apigee.com/about/products_togo.html">API Explorer</a>.<p></p>
<a title="Google provides an API explorer" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-explorer/">Google provides an API Explorer</a>, and they have open sourced the code, and <a title="made it available at Google Code" href="http://code.google.com/p/google-apis-explorer/">made it available at Google Code</a>.<p></p>
Next the <a title="Google API Console" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-console/">Google API Console</a> delivers billing and traffic controls, if this set of tools were made open source, this would be huge for the API community.<p></p>
I've been a big proponent of the need for <a title="open source building blocks" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/04/open-building-blocks-for-an-api/">open source API building blocks</a>.  I say this not to devalue what Apigee, Mashery, and 3Scale bring to the table.  Their stuff rocks.  However there are many other API owners out there who aren't ready for a service like theirs, or can't afford, and a set of open source building blocks is needed.<p></p>
That leaves metrics and analytics.  I think an open source set of API analytics would be the biggest benefit to the industry.   Some APIs don't need billing tools, but everyone needs to measure and control traffic.    I have talked about the need for an <a title="open source set of aPI metrics and analytics" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/31/api-metrics-and-analytics/">open source set of API metrics and analytics</a> before.<p></p>
So I guess I'm saying to Google, Please open source your API Console, like you did the API explorer.  It will benefit the community a great deal, we will deal with API analytics next.
