<a href="http://appstores.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/app-showcase/Appstores.png" alt="" align="right" /></a>When I review a new API, I take a look at the technology they provide, but I tend to focus on the business of their API.<p></p>
One area I look at, is what tools they use to deliver the <a title="building blocks that make of their API" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks.php">building blocks that make up their API</a>.  Did they build it themselves?   Did they use <a title="Mashery" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/mashery-api-services/">Mashery</a>, <a title="Apigee" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/apigee-api-services/">Apigee</a> or <a title="3Scale" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/3scale-api-services/">3Scale</a>?  Are they using other open-source tools or a software as a service (SaaS) provider?<p></p>
I'm always on the look out for new open-source tools or services providers that can be leveraged for APIs in this way.  My goal is to find an open-source solution or service provider for <a title="each one of the building blocks i have defined" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks.php">each one of the building blocks I have defined</a>.  Some examples are:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a title="API documentation with SDK Bridge" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/09/api-documentation/">API documentation with SDK Bridge</a></li>
	<li><a title="API forums with Get Satisfaction" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/30/api-forums-using-get-satisfaction/">API forums with Get Satisfaction</a></li>
	<li><a title="Application Showcase with AppStores.com" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/06/08/a-white-label-api-appstore-platform/">Application Showcase with AppStores.com</a></li>
</ul>
I like to have an open-source tool available for each building block, but having a solid company that can deliver specialized services for a API, and have them up and running instantly is even better.<p></p>
Some characteristics I look for in a service provider are:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Self-service </strong>- Instant registration and activation of services.</li>
	<li><strong>Branding</strong> - The ability to brand and make look like your API area.</li>
	<li><strong>Tiered Pricing </strong>- A pay as you go model allowing small companies to try out first, then grow as needed.</li>
	<li><strong>DNS</strong> - Ability to point subdomain at service, to keep with a single company domain.</li>
	<li><strong>Support</strong> - Quality support from self-service forum to someone you can talk to.</li>
	<li><strong>Focus</strong> - Delivering a high quality service ina  single area, and not trying to be everything to everyone.</li>
	<li><strong>Data Portability</strong> - The ability to take <strong>ALL</strong> of your data with you when you are ready to leave is critical.</li>
</ul>
These are just a few of the key strengths I look for when finding <a title="API Tool" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/category/tools/">API tool</a> and <a title="service providers" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/category/services/">service providers</a>.<p></p>
As an example, take a look at <a title="AppStores.com" href="http://appstores.com/">AppStores.com</a>, they have almost everything I look for in a <a title="building block" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks.php">building block</a> service provider.  They are still working on the self-service and tiered pricing aspects, but its at least on their roadmap.<p></p>
Do you have any open-source tools or software as a service providers that you use to deliver your API?
