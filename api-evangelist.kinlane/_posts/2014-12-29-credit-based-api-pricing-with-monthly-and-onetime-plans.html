<p>I'm reviewing the business models of many of the top API platforms over the last couple of weeks, and I&rsquo;m seeing some pretty interesting approaches to <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com">API monetization</a>. As I look through each API, I see that some platforms don&rsquo;t have their API monetization strategy together at all, while others are following the pretty proven &ldquo;cloud utility&rdquo; model handed down from providers like AWS, and then I see some who are continuing to standardize how we pay for, and monetize APIs--which makes me happy.</p>
<p>One <a href="http://www.convertapi.com/prices">interesting pricing page I reviewed over the holidays</a>, was from the <a href="http://www.convertapi.com">file conversion API, ConvertAPI</a>. They have a credit based API monetization approach, allowing you to buy a certain amount of credits on a monthly basis, or make one-time basis. Each area offers four tiers, allowing for the purchase of credits at a various rates. One thing I found curious though, is that your credits purchased monthly do not roll over, where your one time purchases do&mdash;I will have to think about the pros / cons of this more, before I comment.</p>
<p>The ConvertAPI also has a "<a href="http://www.convertapi.com/prices#CreditsCostTable">credits cost table</a>", providing an overview of how credits actually translate into actual API calls. Many file conversion APIs use a one-to-one rate for making API calls, while others cost 2, 3, or even 5 credits per each API call. I like this approach to defining API costs, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/11/12/an-api-for-developers-to-access-their-api-account-information/">when your API developer account includes a API for monitoring</a> account levels, it <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/02/a-market-for-api-developer-credits/">starts getting us closer to the API pricing standardization</a>, and the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/16/with-number-of-apis-continuing-to-grow-account-automation-will-be-key/">automation we will need to continue the growth of the API economy</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m finding a lot of individual API monetization stories as I go through this latest round of research. I&rsquo;m thinking I will have to spend a couple of weeks in February or March of 2015, step back and look at the monetization strategies of the <a href="http://theapistack.com/">700+ companies I&rsquo;m tracking on</a>, and hopefully provide some better analysis of where we stand with this vital layer of the API industry. Along with the work I&rsquo;m doing to encourage companies to create machine readable API definitions for their APIs, accompanied with machine readable licensing using <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>, I want to help encourage the standardization of API pricing&mdash;then who knows, maybe someday API pricing can be machine readable, allowing us to make real-time decisions on the APIs we use based upon cost.</p>
