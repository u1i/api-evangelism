<p>I was dedicating some time to researching APIs in the Internet of things (IoT) space, and stumbled across the <a href="https://api.myfox.me/">Myfox API</a>, serving the <a href="https://www.getmyfox.com/us_en/">Myfox home security products</a>. While the developer portal for the Myfox API doesn't have everything I'd like to see in an IoT developer portal, it is one of the better one's I've seen.</p>
<p>If you think web or mobile app developers suck at providing a simple, and a coherent developer portal and experience, device platform providers are even worse. The Myfox API, has the essential building building blocks, with a simple overview, authentication info, simple Swagger driven API documentation, application management tools, and a clear terms of service for the platform.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is a clear link between the primary Myfox website, the developer portal, and a <a href="https://myfox.me/">myfox.me user portal</a>, for device consumers and would-be developers to easily on-board with everything. I haven't fully profiled that Myfox platform, but at first glance it is clean, well laid out, and most importantly the link between the website, API, and user accounts is clear, and easy to navigate.</p>
<p>As I think this through, and after recently finishing a white paper called <a href="http://research.gigaom.com/report/building-an-api-driven-ecosystem-for-the-internet-of-things/">Building an API-driven Ecosystem for the Internet of Things</a>, for the now defunct GigaOm, I can't help but think the IoT space is going to need to agree on some sort of standard approach for not just managing how they design, deploy, and manage APIs, but also how they deliver developer and user portals. To help you visualize what I mean, consider the number of Internet connected devices any single household will own, all with their own portal, and on-boarding process. #FUN</p>
<p>In short, developers, and end-users will get IoT account fatigue pretty quick. I don't think that we are going to standardize everything across the space, I am not delusional, but I can't help but think that the sharing of some common blueprints, could go a long ways in reducing friction for developers, and device consumers. I'll take my research from the GigaOm white paper and produce a blueprint, that IoT device makers can use, to to hopefully be more successful in deploying their developer portals, platform accounts, and maybe help influence a tiny bit of consistency in how IoT platforms function.</p>
