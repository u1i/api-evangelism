<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/blog_icon.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />As a building block, a blog is a very valuable tool for building awareness of your API, keeping your developers informed and give a personality to the team beyond an API.</p>
<p>My recommendation to API owners is to always have a blog, however one the most damaging things you can do is stop posting to your blog.  A blog is a key variable in my <a title="API Stack Algorithm" href="/2012/03/15/qualifying-for-the-api-stack/">API Stack algorithm</a>, of whether or not an API is worth integrating with, and if you haven&rsquo;t updated your blog anytime in the last year, I immediately step away.</p>
<p>If you want people to find your API, have a blog.  If you want your existing developers to be educated about what can be done with your API, have blog.  If you want developers who find your API, to feel confident enough to integrate it into their app, keep you blog updated!</p>
