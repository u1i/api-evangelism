So you want to share some data-- perhaps out of the goodness of your heart, perhaps it makes you look good or perhaps you're required to do so.<p></p>
Whatever the case, sharing your data should be done in such a way so that the data is truly open and accessible.

<strong>First:</strong><p></p>
Putting data in a PDF does not really constitute opening and sharing your data!
<ul class="mainlist"></ul>
I don't care how much we all love (or hate) the PDF. PDF has a lot of good uses, but sharing data is not one of them. PDF is a <a class="zem_slink" title="Portable Document Format" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format">Portable Document Format</a> and is great for sharing documents, but it does'nt provide and structure for data. So if you take your data and publish it online in a PDF form you are not making your data open or accessible.<p></p>
<strong>Second:</strong><p></p>
Posting an Excel file to the Internet is a good step, if you speak Microsoftese, but it would be better to export it as CSV (<a class="zem_slink" title="Comma-separated values" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">Comma Separated Values</a>) or TSV (<a class="zem_slink" title="Delimiter-separated values" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter-separated_values">Tab Separated Values</a>). This at least keeps your data structured and by putting it on the Internet your are opening it up.<p></p>
If you really want to think a little further ahead, you might consider importing your Excel spreadsheet as a <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/google/">Google</a> Doc. This will make it public, and will accomplish the same goals as<a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/publishing/">publishing</a> as Excel, CSV or TSV but you also have the added collaboration, sharing and <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">API</a> that comes with <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/google/google-docs/">Google Docs</a>.<p></p>
<strong>Third:</strong><p></p>
If you truly care about the openness and accessibility of your data, you will publish it using a <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/">Restful</a> API. Provide clear documentation on how use your API, and provide as many samples of code in as many different programming languages as you can.<p></p>
Take time to consider your goals in publishing your data to the web, and your intended audience. Make your data as open and accessible as you can.<p></p>
