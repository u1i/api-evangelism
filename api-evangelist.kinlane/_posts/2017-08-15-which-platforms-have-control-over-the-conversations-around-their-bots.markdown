I spend a lot of time monitoring API platforms, thinking about different ways of identifying which ones are taking control of the conversation around how their platforms operate. One example of this out in the wild can be found when it comes to bots, by doing a quick look at which of the major bot platforms own the conversation around this automation going on via their platforms.

First you take a look at Twitter, by doing a quick Google search for Twitter Bots:

Then you take a look at Facebook, by doing a quick Google search for Facebook Bots:

Finally take a look at Slack, by doing a quick Google search for Slack Bots:

It is pretty clear who owns the conversation when it comes to bots on their platform. While Twitter and Facebook both have information and guidance about doing bots they do not own the conversation like Slack does. Something that is reflected in the search engine placement. It is also something that sets the tone of the conversation that is going on within the community, and defines the types of bots that will emerge on the platform.

As I've said before, if you have a web or mobile property online today, [you need to be owning the conversation around your API or someone eventually will own it for you](https://apievangelist.com/2017/07/11/either-you-own-the-conversation-around-your-apis-or-someone-else-will/). The same comes to automation around your platform, and the introduction of bots, and automated users, traffic, advertising, and other aspects of doing business online today. Honestly, I wouldn't want to be in the business of running a platform these days. It is why I work so hard to dominate and own my own presence, just so that I can beat back what is said about me, and own the conversation on at least Google, Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Github.

Seems like to me, if you are going to enable automation on your platform via APIs, it should be something that you own completely, and make sure you provide some pretty strong guidance and direction.
