<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/awis/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/amazon/alexa-logo.gif" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>Amazon recently sent an email to all developers notifying them of upcoming changes to the <a title="Alexa Top Sites API" href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AlexaTopSites/latest/">Alexa Top Sites API</a>.<p></p>
On November 25, 2011 Amazon will deprecate the Alexa Top Sites SOAP API. The SOAP interface has had repeated security issues over the last couple of years, and since only a small percentage of users actually use the API, they decided to decommission it.<p></p>
Alexa will also be enforcing that all requests to the API must be signed using <a title="signature version 2" href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AlexaTopSites/latest/CalculatingSignatures.html">signature version 2</a>.  Version 2 is significantly more secure that the version, and all <a title="Amazon Web Services" href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> are being required to migrate to it.<p></p>
I wonder if Amazon is having similar security issues with other SOAP APIs?   Maybe the other SOAP APIs just have more users and it was worthwhile for them to fix.<p></p>
Makes you wonder how many SOAP users vs. REST users Amazon Web Services has.
