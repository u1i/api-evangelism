<div style="background-color:#ff4c4c; width:100%; height: 40px; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 5px;"><p align="center"><strong>Swagger is now Open API Definition Format (OADF) -- <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/" style="text-decoration:none;"><strong>READ MORE</strong></a></strong></p></div>
<p><a href="http://api.report/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 20px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-report/api-report-logo.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I have been inspired by my partner in crime Audrey Watter's (<a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a>) approach to her weekly news on <a href="http://hackeducation.com/">Hack Education</a>, and will be trying to revive the weekly ritual for API Evangelist, something that I'm going to call the <strong>Weekly API.Report</strong>. I work to try and post API related news on <a href="http://api.report">API.Report</a>&nbsp;each day, but my new Weekly API.Report is looking to to capture my news curation for the week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Weekly API.Report represents the best of what I've read throughout the week, and is only what I personally felt should be showcased. Each news item comes with a link, and some thoughts I had after curating the piece of API related news. I'm trying to break down stories into as coherent buckets as I can, but it remains something that is ever changing for me, but ultimately I will settle on a clear definition for each of the research areas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've seen <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">agriculture</span></strong> related API efforts, but with two in one week, I may have to dive deeper:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://blog.agri-data.net/getting-started-mobile-farm-management-software-agri-data-solution">I'm a Farmer. How Do I Get Started with Farm Management Software?</a> - API driven mobile continuing to target the farmer, and agricultural industry. If I see more IoT, and API related agricultural stories I may have to start a separate research project.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/programmableweb/apis/~3/vbywQMNB2c0/agricharts-getfuturesoptionsexpirations">Agricultural Data, Visualizations, and Mobile Apps from AgriCharts</a> - Interesting moves into specific verticals from Barcharts--it is interesting to see data and visualizations focused on in such valuable ways.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Analysis</strong></span> is an area, I'm going to shave off my larger data API pie, and try to make better sense of how APIs are used for analysis:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="/blog/parsing-complex-data-to-solve-simple-problems/">Parsing Complex Data to Solve &lsquo;Simple&rsquo; Problems</a> - Tracking on valuable data conversations coming out of the realtime space. This is a video.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The area of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">API design</span></strong>, is one of the most important conversations going on right now:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://lucybot.com/">LucyBot - Get your API's consumers moving faster</a> - LucyBot generates cross-language cookbooks for any REST API--that is cool. It looks like LucyBot is poised to do some significant evolution in the Swagger and Blueprint driven API client conversation.&nbsp;</li>

They are adding in a hypermedia layer, the first of the formats to do so. I am still working to understand, and will be covering more.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apiacademy.co/blog/guide-rest-api-design">A Guide to REST &amp; API Design</a> - More API designknowledge from API leader Mike Amundsen.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>I am always looking for innovative new ways to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>evangelise APIs</strong></span>:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheNextWeb/~3/XMKQuI3TG6g/">British bookseller Waterstones hid a reading list for developers in its source code</a> - I thought this was creative, and shows thinking out of the box when looking to reach out to developers.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>LucyBot is duplicate from above, but I think their approach represents an important <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>API integration</strong></span> evolution as well, &nbsp;adding to the fast growing list:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://lucybot.com/">LucyBot - Get your API's consumers moving faster</a> - LucyBot generates cross-language cookbooks for any REST API--that is cool. It looks like LucyBot is poised to do some significant evolution in the Swagger and Blueprint driven API client conversation.</li>
<li><a href="http://codecanyon.net/item/stripe-payment-gateway-kit-for-resellerclub/10443198">Stripe Payment Gateway Kit For Resellerclub (Miscellaneous)</a>&nbsp;- I track on a lot of API integrations, but only some I talk about. This was interesting enough to showcase, especially because it is monetized.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.popsci.com/blow-your-breathalyzer-test-take-uber">Fail This Smart Breathalyzer's Test And It Will Help You Get An Uber</a>&nbsp;- This is another integration that makes me go WTF. Sure, I get that incentivizing drunk folks to use Uber is nice, but think of the privacy considerations. Uber will know every time you are drunk. #FUN</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>This first Weekly API.Report was about 8 hours worth of work for me, in addition to the regular API news curation I do each week. Next week should be easier, as I built some tools to help me. The hard work now is to prioritize the Weekly API.Report each week, providing a regular account of what I've curated.</p>
<p>This post has helped me better absorb what happened this week, something I hope I can achieve each week. I have this same data going back to 2013, as I've been doing the work each week, i just stopped publishing a weekly post when I went to work in Washington D.C. as a Presidential Innovation Fellow--I just got too busy.</p>
<p>Next up for me, is to generate a short summary, and do a companion email newsletter for the Weekly API.Report--stay tuned!</p>
