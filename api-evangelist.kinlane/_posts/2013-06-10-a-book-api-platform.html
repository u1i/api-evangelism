<p>In the last two years I've seen the emergence of&nbsp; cloud platforms that focus on helping data administrators, owners and stewards, generate APIs from their data sources.</p>
<p>The new cloud services like <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com/companies-detail.html?id=28">EmergentOne</a> will mount a MySQL database, spider the tables, and generate a web API for you, while providing you the basic tools you will need to manage access and consumption of that API.</p>
<p>In the same spirit of helping data owners generate APIs, I'd like to see the same types of tools, but designed for books and their authors or publishers.  When I create a book and generate the ePub version, I would like to be able to upload it to a cloud platform, where the service would spider the ePub file and help generate a simple, but meaningful API for the book allowing developers to search, annotate and interact with the books content via web, mobile or tablet applications.</p>

<p>My thoughts are still in the idea stage, I have done very little research on what is out there.  But I would envision something like this would work well will existing platforms like <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a>.  As I do with all my ideas, I will share my thoughts here in real-time as I do the research.</p>
<p>I think in the future, providing default API access to all books will be critical to the syndication across all available distribution platforms.  You can find the seeds of this idea&nbsp; in what <a href="http://developer.pearson.com/apis">Pearson is doing with their product catalog</a>.</p>
<p>As the publishing world slowly wakes up to digital distribution, APIs will become a common tool in the toolbox of authors and publishers.</p>
