<p>Last week <a title="Mashery" href="http://mashery.com/">Mashery</a> rolled out a new on-premise version of their API management proxy. &nbsp;A solution meant to address a common concern of IT and API owners, that when using Mashery, all of their data and resources run through the Mashery proxy in the cloud. &nbsp;This concern can be a show stopper for many companies.</p>
<p>Until this last week, Mashery had four API management solutions that all ran in the cloud.</p>

<p>Now Mashery has separated the proxy portion of their traffic manager into two offerings, one for the cloud and one for on-premise.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/mashery/API-Traffic-Cloud-Local.png" alt="" width="500" align="center" /></p>
<p>Mashery has bundled the new Mashery Cloud and Mashery Local with their existing API Traffic, API Analytics &amp; Reporting and API Portal and are calling it, the Mashery API control center.  Using the API control center you now have the flexibility to deploy on-premise or in the cloud as needed.</p>

<p>Of course the full benefits of the Mashery API Distribution Network which includes scalability, redundancy, PCI compliance, access to global partner network and SLA&rsquo;s are only available for APIs deployed using Mashery Cloud.</p>
<p>Even though the&nbsp;<a title="Mashery API Control Center" href="http://mashery.com/solution/controlcenter/">Mashery API Control Center</a> is meant to provide flexibility of deployment for API owners, the move is clearly a direct shot at their primary competitor Apigee, who have had an on-premise solution for some time, but <a title="Mashery" href="/serviceproviders/mashery.php">Mashery</a> claims their control center provides much more flexibility than "their competitors".</p>
