<p>I open up my Thursdays to briefings, calls, demos and other phone,  skype, and hangout related activities. This morning I received a  walk-through of the <a href="http://justapis.com/">JustAPIs platform</a> from <a href="http://www.anypresence.com/">AnyPresence</a>, taking my thoughts in a much different direction than in my conversation with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/23/pushing-my-api-gateway-thoughts-forward-api-and-single-page-app-development-with-wavemaker/">Wavemaker, which was at the intersection of API design and API gateway in  this new cloud-based, single page application design studio</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>JustAPIs is a downloadable, installable, portable, little API design, deployment, and management engine, which you can install on Linux, Windows, Mac, and even your Raspberry Pi. This represent the functionality I have in mind, when I think about the future of what is an API gateway--a little node that can put <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ANYWHERE</span> to serve up, proxy, and manage my APis.</p>
<p>I downloaded JustAPis, ran at localhost, and begin mapping it to a handful of my remote APIs, and crafting a couple simple APIs to understand what is possible. Its obvious there is still a lot of work to be done, as the whole management side of JustAPIs is under construction, but I like what I see so far. I like the micro gateway characteristic. I think it has potential in not just the API economy, but specifically in the mobile, and IoT layers of the API economy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As with my Wavemaker discussion today, there are aspects of JustAPIs I'd like to see a become a reaility, in the realm of hypermedia, discovery with APIs.json, and portability, and interoperability using API definitions like Swagger and API Blueprint, but it is a great start. JustAPIs is a significant movement forward in the evolution my perception of just what is an API gateway, and after talking with the JustAPIs team, I am confident that because of the extensibility available in the solution, it will become a ubiquitous layer of the API economy.</p>
<p>JustAPIs dovetails nicely with other movements I'm watching in the API space around containerization, and software defined networking. When you have a lightweight gateway that you can launch anywhere, with the ability to launch existing API blueprints, as well as allow extensibility by other API driven services--the landscape will begin to shift quickly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a number of other stories, derived from my conversation with JustAPIs today, but I will save them for the future. I will keep playing with, and exploring the JustAPIs engine. Todays conversation with Wavemaker and JustAPIs has done wonders for my API gateway perspective, at a time where I'm open to possibilities, and determined to move the conversation forward.</p>
