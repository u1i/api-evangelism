<p>I am spending a significant amount of time looking through the pricing pages for leading API providers, working to get a sense for some of the common approaches to API monetization in use across the space. Along the way I am finding some simple approaches from API providers that I wanted to share as bit-size API planning stories here on the blog.</p>
<p><a href="https://auth0.com/pricing">After recently landing on the pricing page for identity service provider Auth0</a>, I saw that they included a simple message and link to the latest blog post about API pricing changes. It is a simple, subtle, yet very prominent approach to making sure your API consumers are aware of pricing changes that may impact their integration. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/04/educating-api-developers-with-each-login-over-at-cloudelements/">I recently wrote about providing a messaging area to reach developers upon platform login</a>, but this approach from Auth0 is about providing relevant messaging no matter where you are at in the developer portal--not just at login.</p>
<p>Couple of lessons for me, extracted from this approach:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Prominent FMA - </strong>Providing a prominently placed, flexible messaging area, can help make sure your API consumers stay up to speed on the latest, when it comes to platform operations.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Pricing Storytelling - </strong>Telling the story around each change in pricing is a critical aspect of operation. Publishing a story on your blog, syndicating out through your social channels, and prominent placement via a FMA is key.</li>
</ol>
<p>This help rekenforce the fact that we should make sure to regularly communicating out our decisions around API monetization. Also making sure there is a saturation factor to our messaging, and that it is available via our blogs, Twitter, LinkedIn, and any other relevant page or channel used to reach API consumers.</p>
<p>I have a whole list of bit-size API monetization, pricing, and planning stories queued up. I will try to space them out, alongside other stories, but you will just have to suffer a little as I spend time expanding on my <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">API monetization</a>, and <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">API plans</a> research areas.&nbsp;</p>
