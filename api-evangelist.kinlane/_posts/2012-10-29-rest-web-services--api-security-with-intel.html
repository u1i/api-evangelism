<p>When it comes to <a title="API Service Providers" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/15/api-service-provider-roundup-for-2012/">API service providers</a>, there is one brand that I would say is widely known, but when we are talking about APIs, often gets overlooked.  That company is Intel.</p>
<p>In addition to a whole suite of SOA and Cloud Middleware, all with an emphasis on security--<a title="REST Web Services &amp; API Security" href="http://cloudsecurity.intel.com/solutions/rest-web-services-api-security">Intel has a REST Web Services Gateway</a>.   This provides a simple solution to the number concern I get from potential API owners:  <strong><em>How do I secure my API?</em></strong></p>
<p>The Intel REST Web Services Gateway provides:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Invoke Security Token Service credential mapping or validation</li>
<li>Ensure throttling and SLAs by REST service</li>
<li>Extend Enterprise audit and compliance to WOA and REST</li>
<li>Detailed XML threat prevention and payload inspection</li>
<li>Service virtualization, proxy, and abstraction as a policy enforcement point</li>
<li>REST API security and management</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find a <a href="http://cloudsecurity.intel.com/white-papers/enterprise-security-for-rest-soap/">summary of the product</a>, a&nbsp;<a href="http://cloudsecurity.intel.com/data-sheets/expressway-service-gateway/">full data sheet</a>, as well as some video tutorials over at <a href="http://cloudsecurity.intel.com/solutions/rest-web-services-api-security">Intel</a>.</p>

<p>If you would like to know more, or have questions make sure and come to <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a> this week in NYC.  Intel will have a session on their approach to APIs, as well as be on a panel that I&rsquo;ll be moderating on API service providers. &nbsp;Intel is also a <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/sponsors.php">gold sponsor of API Strategy &amp; Practice</a>--the event wouldn't be happing if it wasn't for Intel. &nbsp;Thanks!</p>
<p>If that isn&rsquo;t enough!  I will also be doing some workshops with Intel at the <a href="http://www.gartner.com/technology/summits/na/applications/">Gartner AADI conference in Las Vegas</a>, the end of November. &nbsp;So you will have another opportunity to speak with both of us.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t make to either New York or Las Vegas, drop me an email and I&rsquo;ll get you in touch with Intel.</p>
