<p>A long time ago I defined the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/network.html">API Evangelist network</a> using a subway map format, plotting out the different routes you could take, and the locations all along this journey. As with anything I do, this is a work in progress, and I&rsquo;m needing to regularly update this map. Currently it is in an image, and I use an image mapping tool to generate the links&mdash;something that is very time consuming.</p>
<p>I think the subway map is an important metaphor for understanding some potentially complex ideas, and provide a single map, complete with legends, supporting content, and links to more details. My problem is I have several maps I need to create, and maintain on a regular basis. Ideally my subway mapping tool would be dynamic, allowing me to make changes as I went along.</p>
<p>While looking for a solution, I stumbled across <a href="http://kalyani.com/2010/10/subway-map-visualization-jquery-plugin/">Subway Map Visualization jQuery Plugin</a>, by Nik Kalyani. This plugin would work perfectly for what I wanted to do to visualize the API Evangelist network, but I had another project I wanted to do, in which it somewhat fell short in satsifying.</p>
<p>There is a lot of talk about the API lifecycle, and I wanted a way to <a href="http://subway.map.apievangelist.com/lifecycle.html" target="_blank">map out the API lifecycle</a> as I saw it, but this concept isn&rsquo;t something there is a single answer for, and I wanted to hear other providers take on their own API lifecycle. I wanted others to potentially build their own API lifecycle subway maps, so I new that the Subway Map plugin needed to be dynamic&mdash;so I wrapped it in a web API.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still playing with what is possible, but my new&nbsp;<a href="http://subway.map.apievangelist.com/">Subway Map API</a> allows you to generate maps, adding routes, and locations along the routes. The API just takes advantage of all the features that Nik Kalyani added into the plugin, I just provided web APis for them. This project will be changing fast, and I will be resetting the database regularly, so if you play with it, make sure and let me know, so I don't step on your toes.</p>
