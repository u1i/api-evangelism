<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/3D-Printing/3d-printing-warehousing.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />With the growing number of 3D models used in 3D printing there is a building need for warehouse space to store these virtual products, and parts.</p>
<p>Of course this is virtual warehouse space, but it has a lot of the same characteristics of warehousing for physical products.</p>
<p>Google provides a <a title="3D Warehouse" href="http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/">3D Warehouse</a> for users of its <a title="SketchUp" href="http://sketchup.google.com/">SketchUp</a> softare, and <a title="Shapeways" href="http://www.shapeways.com/">Shapeways</a> provides a marketplace and warehouse in the form a <a title="Gallery" href="http://www.shapeways.com/gallery">gallery</a> for its creators.</p>
<p>Cloud Storage will definitely have a role to play in warehousing the growing number of 3D modeling files using platforms like <a title="Google Docs" href="http://docs.google.com">Google Docs</a>, <a title="Box.net" href="http://Box.net">Box.net</a>, and <a title="Dropbox" href="/admin/blog/www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>.</p>
<p>3D Warehouses need to provide search-able, sharable and collaborative spaces that are affordable for designers to store and retrieve their work.</p>
<p>As 3D printing becomes a larger part of the global manufacturing supply chain, virtual warehousing across the globe will also become necessary to provide localized storage solutions.</p>
<p>3D printing offers significant advantages over traditional manufacturing when it comes to warehousing, but it still will be a critical part of the <a title="3D print and manufacturing supply chain" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printing-and-manufacturing-supply-chain/">3D print and manufacturing supply chain</a>.</p>
