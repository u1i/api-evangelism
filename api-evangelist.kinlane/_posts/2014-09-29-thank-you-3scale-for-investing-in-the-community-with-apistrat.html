<p>We just wrapped up the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/index.php">4th edition of @APIStrat in Chicago</a> last week, and once again I&rsquo;m very happy with the way things went, as 400+ folks gathered to discuss APIs. The event had the right tone, and I got the usual flood of comments from attendees, speakers, and sponsors about what a great experience the event was.</p>
<p>I would love to take credit, but all of the responsibility goes to <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale</a> for making it happen. 3Scale takes all the risk, and their rockstar team makes the event a reality&mdash;I just help get folks to the conference, contribute ideas to the schedule, present, and MC as much of the event as I possibly can.</p>
<p>@APIStrat has been helping move forward the conversation in the API space for two years now, starting with <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/2013NYC/">New York</a> and <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/2013SF/">San Francisco</a> in 2013, and now <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/">Amsterdam</a> and <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/index.php">Chicago</a> in 2014, all made possible because of 3Scale's investment.</p>

<p>The number one priority for 3Scale, when it comes to @APIStrat, is to move the conversation forward, while investing in the API community. This is why the event is a success, setting the tone for the conversation amongst sponsors, speakers, and attendees. I&rsquo;m thankful for being able to to take part in @APIStrat, and look forward to digesting all of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/apistrat">videos from Chicago, which are already on YouTube</a>.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already announced that the next @APIStrat will be in Berlin, spring 2015, and we are <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/2014/09/24/as-apistrat-chicago-kicks-off-apistrat-europe-and-us-for-2015-are-in-the-works--we-want-your-input/">accepting input on where it should for the fall of 2015</a>. Let me know if there are any topics you&rsquo;d like to see discussed at @APIStrat 2015, and we'll see about getting your ideas into the lineup.</p>
