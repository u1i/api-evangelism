<p>There is a <a title="new API edition to the healthcare industyr" href="http://www.lifeimage.com/landing/api">new API edition to the healthcare industry</a> this week.  lifeIMAGE launched an API that can be used by developers of healthcare applications, to enable the secure exchange of medical images and related patient records.</p>
<p>Norman Young, President and CEO of ClearCanvas, said <em>&ldquo;We were founded on the simple belief that medical imaging informatics should be accessible to all. Now, using the lifeIMAGE API, users of our FDA-cleared diagnostic viewer will be able to instantaneously share images that are in front of them with any one.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The healthcare is industry that is ripe for API adoption, so I&rsquo;m always looking for &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; new API stories for the space--<a title="lifeimage API" href="http://www.lifeimage.com/landing/api">lifeImage API</a> is perfect.
