<p>I&rsquo;m a little behind in working through my list of new APIs to review.  So I&rsquo;m spending about 3 hours each day going through my list of new APIs accumulated from <a href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a>, Tweets, Bookmarks, Google Alerts and other ways I have for discovering new APIs.</p>
<p>After looking&nbsp;through a couple hundred APIs, I&nbsp;wanted to share some things that stand out, and make me feel someone really doesn't give a shit when they hit publish on their API:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Your entire developer area is a PDF</li>
<li>Really long, incoherent URL for dev area</li>
<li>Dev area is just a page in your help directory</li>
<li>You put google ads on every page of your API documentation</li>
<li>No communication, support or contact information at all</li>
<li>Sign up form that pops up in my face as soon as page loads</li>
<li>Require an NDA before I register</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a handful of things that make me give an API a C or D grade, which means you probably aren&rsquo;t on my radar. &nbsp;But then again if you don't have active blog or twitter or developers aren't talking about you, your API won't register on the radar even with a B grade.</p>
<p>With tools like <a title="3Scale" href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>, <a title="APIhub" href="http://apihub.com">APIHub</a> and <a title="Mashape" href="http://mashape.com">Mashape</a> out there, it isn&rsquo;t hard to hang your API in a professional way, with minimal amount of effort and resources.</p>
<p>After looking through hundreds of APIs I leave with the same feeling:  that there tons of good ideas out there, but 80% of them are just executed very poorly.</p>
