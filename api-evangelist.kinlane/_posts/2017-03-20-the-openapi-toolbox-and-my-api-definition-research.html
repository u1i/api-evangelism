<p><a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/guide/">I have the latest edition of my API definition research published</a>, complete with <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/03/20/a-community-strategy-for-my-api-definition-guide/">a community-driven participation model</a>, but before I moved on to my <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/">design</a>, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com/">deployment</a>, and <a href="http://mangement.apievangelist.com/">management</a> guides, I wanted to take a moment and connect my <a href="http://openapi.toolbox.apievangelist.com/">OpenAPI toolbox</a> to this research.</p>
<p>My API definition research encompasses any specification, schema, or authentication and access scope used as part of API operations, providing a pretty wide umbrella. I am always on the hunt for <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/tools/">specifications, schema, media types, generators, parsers, converters, as well as semantics and discovery solutions</a> that are defining the layers of the API space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is one reason I have my <a href="http://openapi.toolbox.apievangelist.com/">OpenAPI Toolbox</a>, which helps focus my research into the fast-growing ecosystem developing around the <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">OpenAPI specification</a>. I'm always looking for people who are doing anything interesting with the OpenAPI specification. When I find one I get to work crafting &nbsp;a title, description, image, and project link so that I can add to&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/kinlane/openapi-toolbox/blob/master/_data/tools.yaml">the OpenAPI Toolbox YAML file</a>, driving the toolbox website. If you are developing any open tooling that uses the OpenAPI specification <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/openapi-toolbox">please let me know by submitting a Github issue for the toolbox, or if you are feeling brave...go ahead and add yourself and submit a pull request.</a></p>
<p>My OpenAPI Toolbox is connected to my API definition research at the hip. The toolbox is just a sub-project for my wider API definition research. If you are doing anything interesting with API definitions, schema, or scope please let me know. I am happy to add to my API definition research. The best of the best from my <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definition research</a> and the <a href="http://openapi.toolbox.apievangelist.com/">OpenAPI Toolbox</a> will be included in my industry guide, receiving wider distribution than just my network of API Evangelist sites.</p>
