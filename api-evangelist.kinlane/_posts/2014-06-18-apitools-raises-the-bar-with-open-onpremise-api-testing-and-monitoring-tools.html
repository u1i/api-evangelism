<p><a href="https://www.apitools.com/">APITools</a>, the cloud-based API integration services is raising the bar for the space by <a href="https://docs.apitools.com/2014/06/11/announcing-apitools-on-premise-with-open-source-release.html">introducing an open source, on-premise version of their API monitoring service</a>. APITools only launched this year, and because of consumer demands, they moved up the timeframe for open sourcing the platform, which was already on the roadmap.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say after <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design</a>, <a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com">API integration</a> services and tooling, for testing, monitoring, and transforming API calls is one of the fastest growing segments of the API space. We are seeing solid solutions from <a href="http://smartbear.com/">SmartBear</a>, <a href="https://www.runscope.com/">Runscope</a>, <a href="http://www.therightapi.com/">TheRightAPI</a>, <a href="http://nomos-software.com/">Nomos Software,</a> and from API pioneer John Musser, with <a href="https://www.apiscience.com/">API Science</a>, but APITools is definitely raising the stakes with open sourcing theirs offering.</p>
<p>The world of API integration service and tooling is rapidly expanding, and only time will tell whether developers prefer running in the cloud, or on-premise, and what features they are looking for, <a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">something I've been documenting as I study what each of the companies offer</a>.</p>
<p>I suspect, that along with other API design, deployment, and management tools we'll need a mix of freemium, open tiers, on-premise, and enterprise API integration services and tooling, to meet the demands of this fast growing segment that overlaps with both providing and consuming APIs.</p>
