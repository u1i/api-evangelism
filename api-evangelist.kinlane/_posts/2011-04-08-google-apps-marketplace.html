<a title="Google Apps" href="http://www.google.com/a/">Google Apps</a> is an online email, document, and collaboration platform in the clouds.<p></p>
<a title="Google Apps Marketplace" href="http://www.google.com/enterprise/marketplace/">Google Apps Marketplace</a> provides a directory of custom third party applications in various categories for Google App users to add, to their available services.<p></p>
Google Apps Marketplace also provides a self-service platform for application developers to build applications and deliver for free, or for pay, via the Marketplace.<p></p>
Any developer can register for a vendor profile, and:<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/Google-Apps-Marketplace.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Create new application listing</li>
	<li>Provide details of application including category, name, and summary</li>
	<li>Set pricing of application</li>
	<li>Provide external links</li>
	<li>Add screenshot or logo</li>
	<li>Provide screencast or how to video</li>
	<li>Add version information</li>
</ul>
All applications must support Single Sign On (SSO) for Google Account integration.<p></p>
Developers can then build applications in the language and platform of their choice.<p></p>
Once the application is production ready, the Marketplace requires developers to submit applications for approval, providing quality control for the marketplace.<p></p>
Google Apps Marketplace provides a self-service application development platform where custom apps built using Google APIs, can be deployed to Google Apps Business, Government, Education and Non-Profit users.
