<p>I depend on <a href="https://ifttt.com/">If This Then That (IFTTT)</a> to move data around the cloud. &nbsp;I syndicate blog posts from <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> to Blogger and Tumblr. &nbsp;This isn't just blind syndication, it is SEO and also plan B scenarios to make sure my content exists in multiple areas.</p>
<p>When it comes to the IT decisions for API Evangelist, I carefully evaluate what services I use. &nbsp;If I begin to depend on an account, after 6 months I need to start paying a fee to secure some sort of quality of service (QOS). &nbsp;This is how I roll.</p>
<p>Not all platorms allow for this. &nbsp;In my opinion, all FREE platforms should have <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/05/31/provide-release-valves-for-api-rate-limits/">relief valves for users</a> like me, who want to move to some sort of paid account, assuring me some sort of service level agreement (SLA) or I'll move away.</p>
<p>For example: Once I started using Evernote regularly, I moved to the premium level. &nbsp;I bought into Pinboard at an early rate, once I was hooked. &nbsp;Inversely, I can't pay for Twitter, Facebook and some Google services. &nbsp;Today it is about IFTT.</p>
<p>In light of me losing Google Reader I'm taking a hard look at all my services. &nbsp;IFTT is on the chopping block.</p>
<p>I have about 20-30 jobs running at IFTTT, moving data around between my cloud services, in a way I depend on. &nbsp;I need to move this into the realm of premium or paid services. &nbsp;</p>
<p>What are your thoughts? &nbsp;Sell me on your service.</p>
