<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Tag-Cloud-Google-Translate.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" />Back in May <a title="Google deprecated the free version of the Google Translate API" href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/05/spring-cleaning-for-some-of-our-apis.html">Googledeprecatedthe free version of the Google Translate API</a>, and pissed off a lot of people along the way. I talked about <a title="building your business around Google or any other APIs" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/28/building-your-business-around-google-or-any-other-apis/">building your business around Google or any other APIs</a>, and even suggested that Google offer a paid version of the API instead of just shutting down.<p></p>
Today <a title="Google introduced a paid version of the Google Translate API" href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/08/paid-version-of-google-translate-api.html">Google introduced a paid version of the Google Translate API</a> that provides a programmatic interface to access Google's machine translation technology, supporting translations in over 50 languages.<p></p>
The paid version of <a title="Google Translate API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/language/">Google Translate API</a> costs $20 per million (M) characters of text translated (or approximately $0.05/page, assuming 500 words/page), and allows up to 50 M chars/month.<p></p>
Google has give a limit of 100K chars / day until 12/1/2011 for developers who had already created projects in the API console that used the Translate API version 2 prior to today.<p></p>
It sounds like Google has decided on a solid business model that will keep the translation API alive, and allow developers to commercially integrate the service into their applications. Google Tranlsate API is now integrated into the <a title="Google API Console" href="https://code.google.com/apis/console/">Google API Console</a>, and is now one of four Google APIs that have pricing / billing frameworks to support them.<p></p>
Google could have done a better PR job by deprecating the free version of the API at the same time as offering a paid version, but I think Google is trying to figure out how to manage and monetize their APIs just like the rest of us.
