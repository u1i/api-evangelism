SSL will improve API security by encrypting all data communications between 3rd party applications and Google, protecting data from interception by a malicious third party.<p></p>
Google Web Search, Google Maps, Gmail and Google docs all currently support SSL for API access.<p></p>
They are working to introduce SSL support in other APis as well as update existing client libraries and code samples to support SSL.<p></p>
Beginning September 15, 2011, Google will require that all users of Google Documents List API, Google Spreadsheets API, and Google Sites API use SSL connections for all API requests.<p></p>
SSL will further legitimize the integration of Google APIs into third party applications.<p></p>
As applications become more distributed, SSL will become a must have layer to all APIs.
