A common reason for deploying an <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">API</a> is to share data with users outside of your organization.<p></p>
You need to make information accessible to partners or general public, but in a way that's self-service so you can avoid emailing a spreadsheet every time someone asks for something.

You do this with a data API.  Data <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">APIs</a> can:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Provide an list of names and addresses for your upcoming event.</li>
	<li>Deliver news to web sites and <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/mobile/">mobile</a> phone in real-time.</li>
	<li>Deliver products such as books from Amazon.com to other smaller, specialty web sites just focusing on cookbooks.</li>
	<li>Delivers census data from the federal government about who lives in your state to your local unemployment office.</li>
</ul>
A data API is proving to be the easiest way to exchange information -- whether it's between businesses, between the government and the public, or between your Facebook profile and your mobile phone.<p></p>
Web, desktop, and mobile applications are all being developed to depend on data from various private and public APIs.  These data APIs are launched to satisfy our growing appetite for real-time information and updates on a daily basis.
