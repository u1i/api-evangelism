<p>I&rsquo;m looking at new and innovative ways companies are building <a href="/2013/03/04/next-generation-of-api-driven-analytics-and-visualizations/">analytics and visualizations on top of APIs</a>, and one of the new tools I&rsquo;ve come across is <a href="http://impactstory.org/">ImpactStory</a>.  ImpactStory aggregates altmetrics:  diverse impacts from your articles, datasets, blog posts, and more.  But this post isn&rsquo;t about ImpactStory, I&rsquo;ll crunch what they do and write about in another post.</p>

<p>This post is about their usage of feedback, helpdesk, and knowledge base management tool&nbsp;<a title="UserVoice" href="https://www.uservoice.com/">UserVoice</a>, which is a service I always recommend to API owners looking to support different aspects of their API community.</p>
<p>ImpactStory simply has a &ldquo;<em>BETA - Send us Your Feedback</em>&rdquo; image in the top right corner of their site.  When you click on the logo, you are presented with a simple UserVoice form for submitting your ideas of where you think ImpactStory should take their platform.</p>

<p>I think this is a pretty dead simple way of soliciting feedback from your community. Involving your users in your roadmap planning can go a long way in building goodwill with them, and encouraging participation and innovation in other ways.</p>
<p>After I spend more time playing with <a href="http://impactstory.org/" target="_blank">ImpactStory</a>, I&rsquo;ll do another post on what else they are up to, but at first glance its a pretty interesting approach to developing tracking analytics, visualization and other embeddable goodness using APIs.</p>
