<p><a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com">This is the 6th edition of API Strategy &amp; Practice, happening in Austin, TX next week</a>. As one of the organizers, I can say that pulling together the perfect lineup of speakers and topics is always a daunting challenge, but then at some point before the event happens, the schedule always seems to take on a life of its own.</p>
<p><a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/schedule/">The APIStrat Austin schedule</a> has reached that point again. We have enough killer speakers and companies present, it has attracted other killer speakers and companies, resulting in a mindblowing 3 days of workshops, keynotes, panels, and sessions--if you haven't taken a look <a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/schedule/">at the schedule lately</a>, take a few moments.</p>
<p>I was going through, looking for problems, missing photos, etc, and the scope of the people and companies present just struck me how amazing it has become, and I had to share. If you aren't registered, make sure and do so, and if there is someone you think that should be in attendance, feel free to ping me directly--you won't want to miss it.</p>
<p>See all y'all in Austin next week!</p>
