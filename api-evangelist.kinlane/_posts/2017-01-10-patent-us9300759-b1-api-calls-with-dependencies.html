<p>I understand that companies file for patents to build their portfolios, and assert their stance in their industry, and when necessary use patents as leverage in negotiations, and in a court of law. There are a number of things that I feel patents logically apply to, but I have trouble understanding why folks insist on patenting things that make the web work, and this whole API thing work.</p>
<p>One such filing is <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PALL&amp;RefSrch=yes&amp;Query=PN/9300759">patent number&nbsp;US9300759 B1</a>: API Calls With Dependencies, which is defined as:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Techniques are disclosed for a client-and-server architecture where the client makes asynchronous API calls to the client. Where the client makes multiple asynchronous API calls, and where these API calls have dependencies (i.e., a result of one call is used as a parameter in a second call), the client may send the server these multiple asynchronous API calls before execution of a call has completed. The server may then execute these multiple asynchronous API calls, using a result generated from one call as a parameter to another call.</em></p>
<p>Maybe I live in a different dimension than everyone else, but this doesn't sound unique, novel, and really just feels like folks&nbsp;are mapping out all the things that are working on the web and filing for patents. I found this patent while going through the almost <a href="http://amazon.patents.apievangelist.com/">1300 API related patents in Amazon Web Services portfolio</a>. Many of their patents make sense to me, but this one felt like it didn't belong.</p>
<p>When I read these patents I worry about the future of the web. Ultimately I can only <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/?q=%22application+programming+interface%22&amp;type=o&amp;order_by=dateFiled+desc&amp;stat_Precedential=on">monitor the courts for API related patent litigation</a>, and keep an eye out for new cases, as this is where the whole API patent game is going to play out. I'll keep squawking every time I read a patent that doesn't just belong, and when I see any new&nbsp;legal cases I will help shine a light on what is going on.</p>
