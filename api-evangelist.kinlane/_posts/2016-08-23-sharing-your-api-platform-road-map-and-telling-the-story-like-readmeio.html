<p>Sharing your platform's road map with the public, and your community is an often overlooked aspect of API operations&nbsp;but is one that can go a long way to communicate your plans for the future with your community. This is why <a href="http://road-map.apievangelist.com/">I carved the concept out into its own research area, to help me better understand how the successful API providers</a>, as well as API service providers are publishing, sharing, and communicating around their road map.</p>
<p>One example of this recently is out of the API documentation service provider Readme.io, who didn't just <a href="http://readme.io/roadmap/">publish a nice, simple, and clean road map for their platform</a>, they also <a href="https://blog.readme.io/our-new-public-product-roadmap/">told the story of the process</a>. This is a great way to announce that you have a road map for the platform but is also something you should repeat as often as possible, telling the story of what you just added to the road map and as much detail on why.</p>
<p>Sharing your road map, and the story behind goes a long way in lowering the anxiety around what the future holds for your API consumers, something that lets them know that you care about them enough to share what you have planned. In my opinion, a road map for an API platform shows that you have empathy for your community, and is something I like to encourage and support, by showcasing the process of your road map storytelling here on my blog when I can.</p>
