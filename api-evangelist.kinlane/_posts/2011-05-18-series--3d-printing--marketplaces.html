<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/3D-Printing/3d-printing-marketplace.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />Marketplaces are necessary to showcase and make 3D printing products and parts accessible by the public and other potential customers.</p>
<p><a title="Shapeways" href="http://www.shapeways.com/">Shapeways</a> and <a title="Google SketchUp" href="http://sketchup.google.com/">Google SketchUp</a> provide integrated warehousing and marketplaces for 3D designers to showcase their work.</p>
<p>As 3D printing grows, public and private marketplaces will evolve to provide services to showcase 3D products and parts to potential consumers.</p>
<p>Marketplaces will also go beyond showcasing 3D models, and actually act as marketplaces where items can be bid upon, creating virtual economies around 3D manufacturing.</p>
<p>These 3D economies will allow consumers to buy individual or bulk printed versions of 3D models.</p>
<p>3D marketplaces will provide competitive arenas, that creators and designers can find success by offering cheaper, unique and innovative 3D print products.</p>
<p>Marketplaces will represent a re-invented way of buying and selling products that feed an  evolving <a title="3D print and manufacturing supply chain" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printing-and-manufacturing-supply-chain/">3D print and manufacturing supply chain</a>.</p>
