<p>I&rsquo;ve been fortunate enough to be able to cut back on my travel in 2015, and focus on some important research, coding, and writing. I apologize to all the events I&rsquo;ve said no to over the last couple months, but I hit a wall last year with speaking, and trying hard to make 2015 a much more healthier, and balanced year.</p>
<p>With that said, here is where you can find me this spring. I have three places you can find me in April and May:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Berlin, Germany</strong>&nbsp;- You can find me in Berlin, putting on <a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/">@APIDays / @APIStrat, April 24th &amp; 25th</a></li>
<li><strong>Barcelona, Catalonia</strong> - I will be speaking at <a href="http://mediterranea.apidays.io/">APIDays Mediterranea, May 6th &amp; 7th, in Barcelona</a></li>
<li><strong>Broomfield, CO</strong> 
<ul>
<li><a href="http://apistrat.com/2nd-annual-api-strategy-practice-tech-un-workshops-gluecon-2015/">@APIStrat Tech Un-Workshops @ Gluecon May 19th</a> (1:00-5:00 PM)</li>
<li>Leading the Swagger conversation at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Swagger-API/events/221572540/">Swagger API Meetup @ Gluecon May 19th</a> (7:00-9:00 PM)</li>
<li>Gluecon - I will be at <a href="http://gluecon.com/">Gluecon 2015, May 20th, and 21st, speaking</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That is all the speaking I&rsquo;m doing this spring, with one tentative date early in June at BYU. I won&rsquo;t be traveling again until the fall, when we do @APIStrat again, and of course @DefragCon!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to be in Berlin and Barcelona, two of my favorite European cities, and of course Broomfield, CO (specifically the Taproom). I am also excited to not be traveling as much, and able to focus on my wider research, coding, and writing. #thanks</p>
