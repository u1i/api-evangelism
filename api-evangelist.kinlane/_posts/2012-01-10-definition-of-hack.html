     I’m spending a lot of time traveling around the country going to <a title="hackathons" href="/events/">hackathons</a>. I find myself constantly explaining what the term hack means.
</p>
<p>
     I’m blown away by the number of people, even in the tech industry that still see hack as a negative term. At the <a title="AT&amp;T Hackathon" href="/events/att_mobile_app_hackathon_las_vegas.php">AT&amp;T hackathon in Las Vegas</a> , I encountered quite a few hardware folks in town for CES, attending the event. I was asked by one guy, “Are all these people trying to hack someone’s network?”.
</p>
<p>
     So, as part of my 2012 hackathon roadshow, I will take on trying to rebrand the term. Currently, these are the common definitions of the word hack:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>To cut or chop with repeated and irregular blows: hacked down the saplings
     </li>
     <li>To break up the surface of soil
     </li>
     <li>To alter a computer program
     </li>
     <li>To gain access to a computer file or network illegally or without authorization
     </li>
     <li>To cut or mutilate as if by hacking
     </li>
     <li>To cope with successfully
     </li>
     <li>To chop or cut something by hacking
     </li>
     <li>To write or refine computer programs skillfully
     </li>
     <li>To use one's skill in computer programming to gain illegal or unauthorized access to a file or network
     </li>
     <li>To cough roughly or harshly
     </li>
     <li>A rough, irregular cut made by hacking
     </li>
     <li>A tool, such as a hoe, used for hacking
     </li>
     <li>A blow made by hacking
     </li>
     <li>A rough, dry cough
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     The definition I’ve heard, and prefer is:
</p>
<blockquote>
     <strong><em>A quick and dirty programmatic solution to a problem.</em></strong>
</blockquote>
<p>
     I would like to solicit other definitions and feedback of how you’d like to see the term hack used widely in the media and Hollywood.
