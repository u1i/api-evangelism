WebServius provides users with the ability to integrate and store data, and enable access to the data via a REST API with XML and JSON responses.<p></p>
There is support for planning, development, implementation and ongoing management of APIs generated from data sources.<p></p>
WebServius offers two service levels:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Self-Service - </strong>Tier for technical people who can handle the setupthemselves, using the WebServius self-service interface. The self-service plan is free up to 50 API subscribers, with up to 10,000 total API calls per day and 5 calls per second at peak times. If you go over any of the limits of the self-service plan, it costs $1 for every 30,000 API calls.</li>
	<li><strong>Full-Service - </strong>Pricing level if you are planning to create a commercial-grade data API. Service is custom fit to exact needs, starting from data integration, to API download page, to user management. Pricing varies based upon needs.</li>
</ul>
There is also a 20% charge of all revenue made through an API whether it is on the self-service or full-service pricing structure.<p></p>
Using WebServius you can proxy an existing REST API or connect directly to a data service provider, including Amazon SimpleDB.<p></p>
Once data is integrated, WebServius allows you to create custom details, plans, promotions, policies and pricing for the data API you wish to publish.<p></p>
Each published API on WebServius is given a detail page for subscribers to access. There are also options for custom site integration and private label deployment solutions.<p></p>

All subscribers are given API keys and WebServius provides tools for validating API keys, and throttling of API requests.<p></p>
