<p>I'm working on a new trends section of API Evangelist. &nbsp;One area i'm tracking on is the opportunities around 3D printing and APIs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I did some fun research, and <a href="/2011/05/18/3d-printing-and-manufacturing-supply-chain/">laid down some interest thoughts on APIs and 3D printing in 2011</a>. &nbsp;This was part of some research I was doing while working at Mimeo. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As I do with all my research, I blog along the way, to help me learn and organize my thoughts. With this trends research into 3D printing, I am working to understand the major components of 3D printing so I can see where APIs are can have the biggest impact.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I've identified 10 major components of 3D printing:</span></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Creators" href="/2011/05/18/series--3d-printing--the-creators/">Creators</a></strong>&nbsp;- 3D designers of virtual print objects</li>
<li><strong><a title="Scanners" href="/2011/05/18/series--3d-printing--3d-scanners/">Scanners</a></strong>&nbsp;- Scanning hardware for generating 3D models</li>
<li><strong><a title="Modeling Software" href="/2011/05/18/series--3d-printing--3d-modeling-software/">Modeling Software</a></strong>&nbsp;- Applications for building 3D models</li>
<li><strong><a title="File Formats" href="/2011/05/18/series--3d-printing--files--formats/">File Formats</a></strong>&nbsp;- File formats for storing 3D models</li>
<li><strong><a title="Warehousing" href="/2011/05/18/series--3d-printing--virtual-warehousing/">Warehousing</a></strong>&nbsp;- Virtual storage for 3D models</li>
<li><strong><a title="Marketplaces" href="/2011/05/18/series--3d-printing--marketplaces/">Marketplaces</a></strong>&nbsp;- Arenas for showcasing, distributing and ordering 3D products</li>
<li><strong><a title="Printers" href="/2011/05/18/series--3d-printers--printers/">Printers</a></strong>&nbsp;- Companies and hardware that deliver 3D printing</li>
<li><strong><a title="Process &amp; Materials" href="/2011/05/18/series--3d-printing--process--materials/">Process &amp; Materials</a></strong>&nbsp;- The process and materials that go into 3D printing</li>
<li><strong><a title="Makers" href="/2011/05/18/series--3d-printing--makers/">Makers</a></strong>&nbsp;- The people who understand 3D printers, process, materials and industries</li>
<li><strong><a title="Delivery" href="/2011/05/18/series--3d-printing--delivery/">Delivery</a></strong>&nbsp;- Logistics behind getting 3D printed products to consumers</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Of course this is just my perspective of the industry and can evolve as I learn more, and collaborate with other industry players.</span><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/3D-Printing/3d-printing-manufacturing.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This series was just to help me understand the major components, and I will do another series on how APIs can impact these areas. &nbsp;</span>I also have a summary post on&nbsp;<a title="ProgrammableWeb.com" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/">ProgrammableWeb.com</a>&nbsp;about the role of APIs in 3D printing.</p>
<p><span>3D Printing is something I will be talking about a lot in 2013. &nbsp;I think all of these areas I laid out have the potential to be radically transformed by APIs. &nbsp;I will be taking my original research on 3D printing from 2011 and see where I can evolve it based upon what is going on in the 3D printing space in 2013. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
