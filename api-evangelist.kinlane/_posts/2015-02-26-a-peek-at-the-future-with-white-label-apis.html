<p>I&rsquo;ve been <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/30/what-will-it-take-to-sell-my-api-as-a-wholesale-resource/">talking about the possibilities around wholesale APIs for a while now</a>, something that is only going to become more prevalent with the popularity of micro services and containers. I thought <a href="http://www.rechargkit.com/white-label-api">this company's approach to white label APIs</a> was pretty basic, but worth showcasing, providing a glimpse of what is possible when you are talking about B2B APIs.</p>
<p>Recharge kit provides 15 separate APIs for wholesale usage. I thought it was a telco stack of APIs when I first landed, but it is an interesting mix of telco, utility, travel, and more. I predict companies will emerge with a much more nuanced stacks of micro-services than Recharge Kit, but their approach shows some of the thinking occuring in the space.</p>
<p>As part of the Recharge Kit white label package you also get a handful of API management tools, ranging from user management, and advertising, to billing, and support. The overall presentation is not that professional, but a lot of the <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">essential API management building blocks</a> are present.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/02/26/making-my-3scale-api-management-portable-with-a-containerized-microservices/">Delivering API management resources in this portable, and flexible way is reflected in my recent exploration with my 3Scale API management infrastructure on Alpha API Evangelist</a>. I'm looking to understand how not to just manage my B2D or B2C API consumption, but also allow me to deliver on a new wholesale side of my operations. Wholesale APIs deployed as micro services via Docker containers adds a whole new dimension to API management, opening up more B2B, wholesale, and white label API opportunities like this.</p>
