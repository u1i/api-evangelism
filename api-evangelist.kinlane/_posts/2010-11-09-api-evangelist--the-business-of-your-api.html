I have launched a new site called <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com" target="_blank">API Evangelist</a>.  I have been operating in stealth mode because I'm not 100% done with all the API Ecosystem building block pages.  I've had a couple people ask if I'm a perfectionist, and why don't I just launch.  So here we go.<p></p>
My goal behind <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank">API Evangelist</a>. is to go beyond just the technology of APIs or being a directory of APIs like <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com" target="_blank">ProgrammableWeb</a> is.  I want to focus on the business of APIs, which is an area I feel is neglected in over 75% of APIS, even the successful ones.<p></p>
API Evangelist reflects my research, and I'm looking to provide the following types of posts:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Analysis</li>
	<li>Building Blocks</li>
	<li>News</li>
	<li>Review</li>
	<li>Services</li>
</ul>
My goal is to monitor how the leading API providers are delivering their APIs to the world and managing their community.  As I review APIs for the blog I enter them into a database and keep track of building blocks, technology, formats, and other characteristics.  I will be providing more tools for searching and cross-referencing this data as time goes on.<p></p>

This site is my research and learning around the business of APIs, to put to use as the API Evangelist for <a href="http://www.mimeo.com" target="_blank">Mimeo</a>.   As I pay attention to top API providers, API service providers, and best practices around the business APIs I feel there is a lot of value to share, and structuring it in this way helps me learn more.<p></p>
Let me know your thoughts.
