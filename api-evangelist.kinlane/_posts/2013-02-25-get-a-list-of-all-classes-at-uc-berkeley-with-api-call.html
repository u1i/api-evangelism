<p>I see a lot of dead simple, yet meaningful uses of APIs come across my desk (I don&rsquo;t have a desk, why do I keep saying this?) each day.  One I saw today is something every school, whether K-12, college or university should have.</p>
<p>Using the UC Berkeley API, you can get a list of all departments:</p>
<blockquote><em>_curl -v -X GET "https://apis-dev.berkeley.edu/cxf/asws/department?departmentCode=a&amp;app_id=309fe68e&amp;app_key=51b9d67dc4f0501eed763822a641b17b"_</em></blockquote>
<p>Then with the proper department code you can pull a list of classes:</p>
<blockquote><em>_curl -v -X GET "https://apis-dev.berkeley.edu/cxf/asws/classoffering?departmentCode=ARCH&amp;app_id=your-id&amp;app_key=your-key"_</em></blockquote>
<p>With the proper keys, anyone can easily pull relevant UC Berkeley department and class data to use in website or app, or even populate a Google Spreadsheet for other purposes.</p>

<p>The <a title="UC Berkeley API Management" href="https://developer.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley API Management Portal</a> is brand new, I&rsquo;m still working on separate story regarding their approach, but I wanted to talk about how good it is to see such straightforward, valuable uses of an API at a leading university.</p>
<p>This simple example is something you should be able to do by default at all schools across the country.</p>
<p>The best part is that the API team is actively communicating these uses of the API on Google+, which is how I came across the story.</p>
