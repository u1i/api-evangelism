Giving away cash and prizes is a quick way to  get developers understanding your API and to get press coverage as well.<p></p>
<a href="http://mygengo.com/" target="_blank">myGengo</a>,  a translation software as a service (SaaS), has cooked up a contest  offering up to <a href="http://mygengo.com/services/api/lab" target="_blank">$30K in cash and rewards to encourage development of  specific plugins that use the myGengo API</a>.<p></p>
myGengo  provides a list of popular CMS, SNS, E-Commerce, forums, browser  plugins, and SaaS platforms for developers to choose from. You can  request adding a new framework or platform if you wish.<p></p>
In  addition to increasing public and developer awareness of the myGengo AP  platform, the company is getting a full suite of code libraries and  plugs for all major platforms on a fixed budget of 30K. Seems like an  excellent way to develop code around your platform while keeping it  within a specified budget and without bringing in any new development  resources or training for new platform and languages.<p></p>
The  myGengo API contest demonstrates a new trend in marketing your API,  building a community, and establishing a wide selection of code.
