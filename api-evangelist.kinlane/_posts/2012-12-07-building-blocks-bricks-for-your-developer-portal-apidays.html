<p>I gave a talk at <a title="API Days" href="http://apidays.io/">API Days</a> in Paris, France this week. &nbsp;This talk was using some of my usual material around the <a title="building blocks of an API" href="http://apievangelist.com/the_building_blocks_of_a_successful_api.php">building blocks of an API</a>. As I always do, I omitted some slides and evolved my presentation a little further. &nbsp;This is one benefit of using <a title="reveal.js" href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/">reveal.js</a>, driven from the API Evangelist database--I can evolve my content and make better with each talk.</p>
<p>I discussed 5 main areas to consider when building your API developer portal:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>History of APIs</li>
<li>API Design &amp; Planning</li>
<li>API Development</li>
<li>API Evangelism</li>
<li>Whats Next for APIs?</li>
</ul>
<p>My goal is to keep organizing and sharing my view on API design, planning, development and evangelism so my readers can put to use in their own API efforts.</p>
<p>It was interesting to talk through my <a title="API Building Blocks" href="http://apievangelist.com/buildingblocks/">API building block</a> approach with API owners in France, after giving my talk. &nbsp;I learned a lot by talking with folks there. &nbsp;And I really think Europe has huge opportunity in front of it, when it comes to the API economy.</p>
