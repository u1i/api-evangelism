<p>The approaches to BaaS pricing are still evolving. &nbsp;Most of the providers have gone with an API call or storage cost approach to pricing, but there still is much debate about just which pricing model is most beneficial to developers and will ensure BaaS providers are profitable.</p>
<p>The struggle in BaaS pricing reflects a struggle between BaaS platform providers covering their costs, while generating a profit for investor,s and the demands of developers who are often needing to start with a freemium tier, but may have radically different needs once their applications are in production, serving potentially hundreds or thousands of users.</p>
<p>Today, you see most BaaS providers pricing reflect the platform in which they are built on. &nbsp;Many of the current BaaS providers operate on Amazon Web Services, so the BaaS pricing is currently reflecting their upfront platform costs, compute and storage.</p>
