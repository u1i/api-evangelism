<p>Here is a video of one of my talks from&nbsp;<a title="API Days" href="http://apidays.io/">API Days in Paris</a>, France where I walked the internal side of APIs. This talk is derived from my post, <a title="the secret to amazons success is internal" href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/06/10/lessons-in-api-deployment-from-netflix/">the secret to amazons success is internal</a> and stories I've written on <a title="Netflix's success with internal APIs" href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/06/10/lessons-in-api-deployment-from-netflix/">Netflix's success with internal APIs</a>.</p>
