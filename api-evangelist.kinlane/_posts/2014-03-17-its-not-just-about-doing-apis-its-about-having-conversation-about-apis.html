<p>Its always funny to come across the hyperbolic folks that exist in technology, that blindly believe that technology will save us. I seem to get attract a lot of these people with my API Evangelism (its the name), which on the surface I can imagine seems like I'm advocating use of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">APIS BY EVERYONE</span>, in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ALL SITUATIONS</span>--when in reality, this is furthest from the case.</p>
<p>At API Evangelist, I focus on having <span style="text-decoration: underline;">conversations about APIs in all situations</span>, but not necessarily the deployment or consumption of APIs. I don't think APIs by themselves are a solution. I think APIs employed by a savvy business and technology team, providing access access to valuable data, content and other resources to consumers, are a good idea. My missions is for:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>businesses to understand how APIs can potentially benefit them, and change how they operate internally, with partners and the public at large and even influence how an entire industry operates</li>
<li>government of all shapes and sizes to know that APIs can help democratize access to public resources, empowering the public to help share the load of governing cities, counties, states / provinces and countries</li>
<li>every individual to realize the messages, photos, banking, location, and other information they depend on via their cell phone travels through APIs, and that they, the end-user has an important role to play</li>
</ul>
<p>I do not want every business and object in our life to have an API and be connected to the Internet. I evangelize an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">awareness and healthy understanding of APIs by everyon</span>e, as well as sensible approaches to designing, deploying, managing and evangelizing APIs.</p>
<p>This is what happens at <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/index.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a>. If we were just pushing APIs for everything, the name would be something like APIs - Do It!  In reality the conference in Amsterdam next week will be a mix of business and technical folks, listening to the stories from API leaders, about their strategy and practices from their company trenches--taking what they learn back home to apply in their own businesses and organizations.</p>
<p>It makes me very happy that so many folks are waking up to the conversation, and it isn&rsquo;t just happening in the US. We will be talking <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/index.php">APIs in Amsterdam next week</a>, as well as <a href="http://apidays.io/">Berlin and Barcelona in May at API Days</a>--spreading the conversation.</p>
