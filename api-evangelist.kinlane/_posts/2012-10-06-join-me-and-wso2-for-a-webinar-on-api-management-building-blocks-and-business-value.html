<p>I will be doing a webinar with Chris Haddad (<a href="https://twitter.com/cobiacomm">@cobiacomm</a>) of <a title="WSO2" href="http://wso2.com/">WSO2</a> on October 9th, where we discuss <a title="API management best practices for digital business ecosystem" href="http://wso2.org/library/webinars/2012/10/wso2-case-study-api-management-building-blocks-business-value/">API management best practices for digital business ecosystem</a>.</p>
<p>WSO2 is one of my partner API server providers.  I&rsquo;m a big supporter of what they do because they were the first open source API service provider to emerge out of the <a title="20 API Service Providers" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/15/api-service-provider-roundup-for-2012/">20 API service providers</a> in the space.</p>
<p>Chris and I will be exploring a couple are of specific areas, regarding the business of APIs:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Emerging API economy and digital business ecosystems</li>
<li>How to assemble the building blocks of a successful API</li>
<li>When a complete open source API management platform delivers business value</li>
<li>Future trends in maximizing the value of APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>WSO2 brings a wealth of API experience to the table and I look forward to exploring these areas with Chris.    The webinar titled "<a title="WSO2 Case Study &ndash; API Management Building Blocks and Business Value" href="http://wso2.org/library/webinars/2012/10/wso2-case-study-api-management-building-blocks-business-value">WSO2 Case Study &ndash; API Management Building Blocks and Business Value</a>", will be on Tuesday, October 9, at 9:00 a.m. &ndash; 10:00 a.m. PDT.</p>
