<p>Netflix officially announced they will be ending support for their public API. Its no surprise, as they <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/03/12/netflix-api-is-much-more-than-a-public-api/">announced early in 2013 that they would longer accept new registrations for the API</a>.</p>
<p>While I think that Netflix could have put more resources into their API, and fought harder to make their public API a success, I still consider Netflix to be one of API pioneers that we can learn from when crafting our own API strategy.</p>
<p>While the public Netflix API was not a success, the internal and partner API strategy at Netflix was a success. APIs have allowed the company to scale into the cloud, grow internationally, and expand to sever over 1000 devices via their trusted partner network.</p>
<p>In addition to the internal API success at Netflix, they have been amazing at sharing their knowledge and experience with the wider API community via their blog, conferences like <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a>, and in books like <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920021223.do">APIs: A Strategy Guide</a>, available on O'Reilly Publishing, written by Daniel Jacobsen, Greg Brail and Dan Woods.</p>
<p>Another positive byproduct of Netflix API operation, is that the company has been prolific in open sourcing the technology that goes into the API stack. When you visit the <a href="https://github.com/Netflix">Netflix Github account</a>, you will find a wealth of open tooling that they have worked hard on, and opened up for public use.</p>
<p>API success varies widely from company to company, sector to sector, and it doesn't always look like you think it will&mdash;this is part of the API experience. Just because Netflix doesn't reflect one vision of API success that open developers believed in, it doesn't mean Netflix as a whole was an API failure. There are plenty of lessons to learn from their public API failure, as well as their internal API success.</p>
