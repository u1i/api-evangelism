<div style="background-color:#ff4c4c; width:100%; height: 40px; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 5px;"><p align="center"><strong>Swagger is now Open API Definition Format (OADF) -- <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/" style="text-decoration:none;"><strong>READ MORE</strong></a></strong></p></div>

<p>This is the third week in a row I've managed to do this weekly report, something that took me about 9 hours of work, so I can see that the amount of work will vary pretty dramatically each week. Doesn't matter, I'm in for the long haul now, butI'm guessing Monday morning is going to be the common release date, as I start wrapping up on Saturday, but often can't do all the heavy lifting until Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The Weekly API.Report represents the best of what I've read throughout the week, and is only what I personally felt should be showcased. Each news item comes with a link, and some thoughts I had after curating the piece of API related news. I'm trying to break down stories into as coherent buckets as I can, but it remains something that is ever changing for me, but ultimately I will settle on a clear definition for each of the research areas.</span></p>
<p>You don't often see me lead into a story with <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">accounting</span></strong>, but Xero is pushing forward with their world domination plan, worthy of highlighting:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.xero.com/blog/2015/03/new-zealand-payroll/">Introducing New Zealand Payroll in Xero</a> - Xero is definitely the one to watch, with their expansion.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.xero.com/blog/2015/03/uk-payroll/">Introducing UK Payroll in Xero</a> - I think I will have to do an account API roundup, profile the strongest players, and get a better handle on this.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>There were a number of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>acquisitions</strong></span>, that were worth enough of showcasing this week:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://api.report/2015/03/06/ibm-acquires-alchemyapi-enhancing-watsons-deep-learning-capabilities/">IBM Acquires AlchemyAPI, Enhancing Watson's Deep Learning Capabilities</a> </li>
<li><a href="https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/2015/03/04/ibm-acquires-alchemyapi/">IBM Acquires AlchemyAPI</a> - IBM has been beating their API drum lately, and the Watson team has been a significant portion of this drumbeat--interesting to see them making API related acquisitions. I use AlchemyAPI, so this impacts me.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/ibm-powers-up-watson-with-alchemyapi-acquisition/">IBM powers up Watson with AlchemyAPI acquisition</a> - Mentioned already, but I always like to include one outside view in the conversation.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.docker.com/2015/03/socketplane-excited-to-be-joining-docker-to-collaborate-with-networking-ecosystem/">SocketPlane Excited to Be Joining Docker to Collaborate with Networking Ecosystem</a> - This is an interesting move by Docker. Networking related API and container related stories seem to be popping up more. Usually they are just SDN API stories, but this acquisition is an interesting sign of whats to come.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="https://gigaom.com/2015/03/03/box-buys-subspace-to-court-more-risk-averse-clients/">Box buys small security startup to court more risk-averse clients</a> - Using security acquisitions to boost your street cred is a worthy investment in the current landscape. You can just do it, but buying a company to add to stack, sends a good message to your consumers.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/OrgsyncBlog/~3/iLYd6GFA1Mg/orgsync_is_acquired_by_imodules">OrgSync Acquired by iModules Software</a> - An interesting education related acquisition. I will have to learn more about iModules, and keep an eye on what they are doing in the higher education constituent management API space.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.akamai.com/html/about/press/releases/2015/press-030215.html">Akamai Acquires Xerocole</a> - Like security, DNS related investments are wise. Especially if your doing things at Internet scale like Akamai.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="https://gigaom.com/2015/03/02/paypal-acquires-paydiant-puts-nfc-into-its-here-readers/">PayPal acquires Paydiant, puts NFC into its Here readers</a> - At some point I will have to connect the dots on all the payment space moves, lots of action. Almost too much to keep track of.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Advertising</strong></span> is not something usually here, but at the intersection of gaming, I'm a little more interested:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://developer.amazon.com/post/TxRVIU79H0XNDZ/Get-Started-with-the-Amazon-Mobile-Ads-API-in-Your-iOS-App-or-Game">Get Started with the Amazon Mobile Ads API in Your iOS App or Game</a> - I will have to do more research on how big the mobile advertising space is, and see what portion of that is gaming. I'm not usually big on paying attention to advertising, but monetization for a vertical like gaming is interesting enough to track on.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>I am working to pull together <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>analytics</strong></span> specific research project over the next week. It is one of those areas I'm carving off of data:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/developer-relations/2015/03/lightning-components-analytics-api.html">Build Reporting Apps Using Lightning Components and the Salesforce Analytics API</a> - I'd like to see more stories about building dynamic reporting solutions from API providers. There is a lot of opportunity to build simple tools for end-users here.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/03/04/what-is-the-digital-analytics-program-dap/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=what-is-the-digital-analytics-program-dap">What is the Digital Analytics Program (DAP)?</a> - I got a sneak peek of this in action while i was working in Washington DC. I think this type of analytics in aggregate across government, institutions and other aspects of our public world makes sense. I'd like to see APIs that provide access to anyone looking to better understand how government operates (or doesn't).&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://thenextweb.com/google/2015/03/02/google-launches-player-analytics-and-custom-native-ads-tools-for-gaming-developers/">Google launches Player Analytics and custom native ads tools for game developers</a> - More gaming news. At some point I'm going to start a gaming research site, as I see more API, and API adjacent stories in this space.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>I am moving <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">API definitions</span></strong> out of the API design realm, where I can showcase the benefits of machine readable formats:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.apigee.com/detail/apigee_product_highlight_video_smartdocs">Apigee Product Highlight Video: SmartDocs</a> - I thought was an introducing highlight of SmartDocs on the Apigee platform, or as I call them interactive docs. I like seeing how each of the API providers view the benefits of machine readable API definitions like Swagger--Apigee is definitely invested in Swagger.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>These are my thoughts on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>API deployment</strong></span> for the week:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/07/we-need-an-open-library-of-the-most-common-utility-api-implementations">We Need An Open Library Of The Most Common Utility API Implementations &middot;</a> - This seems like a no brainer to me. Someone should step up and build a platform to house these, and figure out some way of generating revenue around this, in a way that you can offer the open source designs for free. Maybe premium services, or custom deployments could be enough to pay for it? It is another area that if someone doesn't step up I may start creating and publishing to a Github repo.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Some interesting <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>API design</strong></span> discussions this week, from the pragmatic, to the restafarian:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/04/making-sure-my-api-roundup-stories-are-machine-readable-by-designing-them-as-apisjson-collections/">Making Sure My API Roundup Stories Are Machine Readable By Designing Them As APIs.json Collections &middot;</a> - A look into how I'm using APIs.json to build collections of APIs. As I research specific areas of the industry, I am trying to create these machine readable definitions, that eventually can turn into something so much more.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://cloud-elements.com/post-effyouthisistherighturl-restful-api-design/">POST /eff/you/this/is/the/right/url &ndash; RESTful API Design</a> - I love creative, pragmatic stories on API design. This one made me laugh, and definitely made me reflect on some of the whacky shit I do when it comes to API design, and you know, that is ok!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/news/dropbox-sparks-controversy-api-design-decision/analysis/2015/03/03">Dropbox Sparks Controversy With API Design Decision</a> - I really do not get all worked up about design decisions like this. Whatever. It is their choice, as long as they communicate it out effectively, it doesn't really change the game to much. I prefer to just showcase the decisions API designers make, and why, and let you decide the best path forward for you.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/04/my-api-design-research">My API Design Research</a> - Rewriting the home page for my API research, while I spend some time pondering what is the current state, and what might be next for my work in this area.&nbsp;</li>

Some really interesting concepts to weave into API design practice here.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-amundsen-richardson-foster-alps-01">Application-Level Profile Semantics (ALPS)</a> - Shit is getting real for ALPS. I keep meaning to add it to my wheelhouse of API design knowledge, but haven't had the time. Looks I better prioritize, as they are getting real with it.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://nordicapis.com/common-cases-when-using-soap-makes-sense/">Common Cases When Using SOAP Makes Sense</a> - It is ok to use SOAP, especially if you work with the enterprise, or take showers every day like I do! ;-)&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://evertpot.com/dropbox-post-api/">Dropbox starts using POST, and why this is poor API design.</a> - While I may not have an opinion directly about this, I do love hearing what everyone else has to say.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>As usual, I'm leading the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>API discovery</strong></span> conversation:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/07/a-breakdown-of-my-dream-apisjson-file/">A Breakdown Of My Dream APIs.json File &middot;</a> - It could happen! If I believe hard enough, or maybe work hard enough and create enough APIs.json for other people to reach the tipping point.&nbsp;</li>

</ul>
</div>
<p>A handful of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>API evangelism</strong></span> discussions throughout the week:</p>

</ul>
</div>
<p>I predict <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>API integration</strong></span> conversation will keep dominating the landscape:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://blog.runscope.com/posts/sharing-http-requests">Sharing HTTP Requests Publicly or Privately When You Need Help Debugging an API Call</a> - I'm really digging how Runscope is opening up this layer of API integration, and making it more conversational and social.

<li><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/danwoods/2015/02/27/why-api-monitoring-matters-to-every-business/">Why API Monitoring Matters To Every Business</a> - Not a big fan of linking to Forbes articles (cause their shitty ads), but an interesting story about my API homie John Musser.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Lots to learn in the area of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>API management</strong></span> this week:</p>
<div>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://developer.intuit.com/blog/2015/03/03/top-20-intuit-developer-questions">Top 20 Intuit Developer Questions</a> - I like the idea of doing a top X FAQ blog post regularly. As an API provider you should also have a dedicated FAQ page, but grabbing the top questions, and publishing on the blog regularly can help get the word out!</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>I am hoping that the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>API podcasts</strong></span> that have emerged keep it up, and new one's continue to emerge:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://apisuncensored.io/">APIs Uncensored</a> - Another episode from SmartBear on their APIs Uncensored podcast. They had Tony Tam over from Swagger, for a very interesting conversation.&nbsp;</li>
