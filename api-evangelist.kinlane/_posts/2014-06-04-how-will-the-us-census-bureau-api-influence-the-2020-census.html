<p>I've been tracking on the <a href="http://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/miscellaneous/cb12-135.html">API from the US Census Bureau since they launched in 2012</a>, and even <a href="https://plus.google.com/+KinLane/posts/4suNfHBWfUE">met with them to discuss their strategy</a> over the last couple years. The team at the Census Bureau has slowly integrated an external API into their operations, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/07/19/providing-full-data-download-vs-api/">opening up conversations around census survey data</a>, that is harder to achieve from just downloads only.</p>
<p>I recently saw a <a href="http://www.commerce.gov/blog/2014/06/03/research-2020-census-continues-%E2%80%93-census-bureau-opens-temporary-office">post that Census Bureau is gearing up for the 2020 census</a>. As I was reading the post, I couldn't help but think about how the Census API will influence how the 2020 census is executed. Additionally I wonder if any other APIs will be used during the census process, such as Twitter or other social platforms.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the census, and its resulting data will continue to be a cornerstone of the API and open data space. Census data adds a lot of value to other websites, mobile apps, and data visualizations and analysis, and is critical in providing context for both our online and offline worlds. I will continue to keep an eye on the <a href="http://www.census.gov/developers/">US Census API</a>, and look for signs of how APIs are influencing the 2020 census.</p>
