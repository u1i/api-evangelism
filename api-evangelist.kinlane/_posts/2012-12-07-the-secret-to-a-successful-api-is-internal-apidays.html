<p>I had the pleasure of speaking at <a title="API Days" href="http://apidays.io/">API Days</a> in Paris, France this week.  The organizers originally asked me to do one talk, but after some speaker shuffle, I ended up with three separate talks on APIs.</p>
<p>The second talk I did at API Days was <a title="The Secret to a Succesful API is Internal" href="/talks/apidays/internal-apis/" target="_blank">The Secret to a Succesful API is Internal</a>. &nbsp;This material was evolved from past stories I've done on <a title="Amazon" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">Amazon's</a> and <a title="Netflix" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/06/20/apis-power-netflix%E2%80%99s-move-to-cloud-enabling-world-domination/">Netflix's</a> success with internal APIs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I really want to tell more stories about other companies who have had success with internal APIs. But these are the hardest stories to come by, and I feel they are some of the most important API stories we can tell. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have a great internal API story you'd like to tell, I love to hear more. &nbsp;Feel free to email or DM on Twitter, and we can figure out the best format to tell your story.</p>
<p>You can view my presentation of&nbsp;<a title="The Secret to a Succesful API is Internal" href="/talks/apidays/internal-apis/" target="_blank">The Secret to a Succesful API is Internal</a> from <a title="API Days" href="http://apidays.io/">API Days</a>, and I believe the session was video taped, so I'm sure there will be videos coming soon!</p>
