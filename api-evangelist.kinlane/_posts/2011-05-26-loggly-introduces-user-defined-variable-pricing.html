<a title="Loggly" href="http://www.loggly.com/">Loggly</a> recently changed the structure for their cloud-based logging service from a tiered pricing, to a <a title="user-defined variable pricing structure" href="https://www.loggly.com/pricing/">user-defined variable pricing structure</a>.
<p></p>Users can define their own pricing tier using two key variables:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Daily Log Volume - 200MB to 8 GB
     </li>
     <li>Log Retention Time - 1 Week to 180 Days
     </li>
</ul>The pricing change was in response to a growing user base, and demand for volumes greater than 2GB/day.
<p></p>Loggly still offers a free plan which supports 200MB/day and retention of 7 days. There is also a beginning paid plan that starts with 200MB/day, but has retention of 15 days, starting at $8/month.
<p></p>Loggly is also adding support for secure syslog (TLS), HTTPs on web inputs, and log archives on all account levels including the free plan.
<p></p>This is a great example of Software as a Service (SaaS) and API service providers innovating around monetization and trying to find the best approach that fits their customers needs and the services they offer.
