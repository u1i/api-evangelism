<p>
     Twilio just made their first move into Europe by offering <a title="Twilio Voice Service in the United Kingdom" href="http://www.twilio.com/blog/2011/10/twilio-launches-in-europe-opens-office-london.html">Twilio Voice service in the United Kingdom</a>.
</p>
<p>
     The <a title="Twilio Voice API" href="http://www.twilio.com/api/voice">Twilio Voice API</a> is now available in the UK, allowing developers to launch local phone numbers in the country. Â Along with the release Twilio has announced the opening of their first international office based in East London.
</p>
<p>
     The UK launch is the first to go live of five countries currently in Beta including France, Poland, Austria, Denmark and Portugal with several more countries on the way.
</p>
<p>
     Twilio's APIs have proven a favorite of developers, and fast becoming an essential cloud computing service for applications.
</p>
<p>
     The move into Europe will only grow their developer base and the number of applications using the cloud telephony API. Something that traditional telcos should take notice of.
