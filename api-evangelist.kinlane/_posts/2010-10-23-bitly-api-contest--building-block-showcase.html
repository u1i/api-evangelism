<a href="http://bit.ly" target="_blank">bit.ly</a> is a popular URL shortening service that offers an API as part of its core software-as-a-service.<p></p>
In January 2009 it held a successful API contest and is looking to do it again with a new <a href="http://blog.bit.ly/post/1307062006/its-a-bit-ly-api-contest" target="_blank">bit.ly API contest</a>.<p></p>
The prizes offered::
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>1st prize - Makerbot Thing-O-Matic 3D Printer</li>
	<li>2nd prize - 1TB USB hard drive enclosed in a vintage nintendo game (Zelda, Metroid, etc)</li>
	<li>3rd prize - Set of BuckyBalls magnetic building spheres</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://bit.ly" target="_blank">bit.ly</a> encourages developer to be creative and come up with unexpected uses, but it also plants a few ideas that the company woul'd like to see developers work on.<p></p>
There are a lot of developers that may know about your API, but not actively involved.  Your developers may need a little bit of motivation to get them working.<p></p>
An API contest is a great way to light the fire under your development community, stimulate innovative uses of your API, and generate some buzz around your API community.
