<p>I was reading the news about "<a href="http://blog.bandpage.com/2014/03/31/bandpage-raises-funds-to-help-musicians-reach-and-monetize-billions-of-fans-worldwide/">BandPage raising $9.25M to help musicians reach and monetize billions of fans worldwide</a>" today, which in itself isn't all that exciting. Sorry, while VC investment in companies that have APIs is a relevant data point, I just don't think its newsworthy enough to warrant its own blog post, usually just a tweet.</p>
<p>One thing that I did find interesting in this post, was the image depicting the distribution via the BandPages platform:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/bandpage/band-pages.png" alt="" width="575" /></p>
<p>This image provides a very simple and clear way to articulate the value delivered via an API driven platform--showing users what BandPages does in a single image.</p>
<p>I wish every API I came across had an image like this, demonstrating what value the API delivers, in a very visual way.</p>
