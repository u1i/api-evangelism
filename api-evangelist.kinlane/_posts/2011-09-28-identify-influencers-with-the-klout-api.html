<p><a title="Klout API" href="http://developer.klout.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/klout/Klout-API-Overview.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a title="Klout" href="http://klout.com/">Klout</a> just updated their API area. The <a title="Klout API" href="http://developer.klout.com/">Klout API</a> was originally released in 2009, but the new API area has several improvements including faster response times for the API, better documentation and improved terms of service.</p>
<p>Using the Klout API developers can pull someones Klout Score, which is the measurement of their overall online influence using social networks like Twitter, LinkedIn and Google+.   It provides a way of essentially high-grading users on your network, and rewarding or engaging users differently based upon their overall network influence.</p>
<p>I categorize the Klout API as a &ldquo;partner API&rdquo;, meaning that can add value to just about any existing API community and application.  For example, with my <a href="http://developer.mimeo.com/">Mimeo Connect Document Printing APIs</a>, a print application could offer lower pricing to a user based upon their Klout score.  If you are building a poster, flyer or book printing application and you offer lower pricing to people who are influencers, you can probably bet they&rsquo;ll talk about your app within their network.</p>
<p>The Klout API opens up a lot of opportunities for web and mobile app developers to enrich their understanding of their existing user base, identifying the users that are the biggest influencers, and may contribute to a larger network effect around their application.</p>
<p>Klout has delivered their API using the <a title="Mashery API Platform" href="/serviceproviders/mashery.php">Mashery API platform</a>, you can register for an API key and learn more about the platform at <a title="developer.klout.com" href="http://developer.klout.com">developer.klout.com</a>.</p>
