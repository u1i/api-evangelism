In addition to the <a title="Growth in Number of APIs" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/08/programmable-web-3000-apis-and-growing/">growth in number of APIs</a>, and the evolution of<a title="BizDev 2.0" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/07/biz-dev-2-0/">BizDev 2.0</a>, there is a rise in self-service application platforms accompanying APIs, within many cloud platforms.<p></p>
Platforms such as <a title="Google Apps" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/google-apps-marketplace/">Google Apps</a> and <a title="Box.net" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/box-net-openbox/">Box.net</a> are adding these self-service application development environments within their API ecosystem.<p></p>
Each platform has its own approach to this type of self-service architecture, but there are many similar characteristics:<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/self-service.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Applications</strong> - Interface for defining new application characteristics.</li>
	<li><strong>OpenID / OAuth / User Resource Access</strong> - Secure and granular access to users profile and resources.</li>
	<li><strong>Development Environment</strong> - Controlled, secure environment for developers to build applications in.</li>
	<li><strong>Application Branding</strong> - Branding of application and its profile on a platform.</li>
	<li><strong>Application Approval Process</strong> - Approval process for bringing applications live.</li>
	<li><strong>Marketplace Environment </strong>- Public or private marketplaces for developers to publish applications and platform users to browse / add applications.</li>
</ul>
<a title="Salesforce" href="http://www.salesforce.com">Salesforce</a> is building in-roads into the enterprise using this model, and <a title="Facebook" href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/facebook/">Facebook</a> has found success with social gaming using a similar approach.<p></p>
