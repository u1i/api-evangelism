<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/api-evangelist-logo-400.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />Sorry about the flood of 25 API Evangelist posts. &nbsp;It was due to the fact I switched to a new blogging system today.</p>
<p>I was out growing what I could do with Wordpress, and had too much data and other research I need to link together to show the bigger picture of whats going on with APIs.<br /><br />API Evangelist has always been a hybrid Wordpress blog and custom CMS system system I wrote. &nbsp;Over the last couple months I rewrote my CMS, and re-lauched with 7 new systems:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Blog" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/blog/">Blog</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a title="Industries" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/industries/">Industries</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a title="APIs" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/apis/">APIs</a>&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li><strong><a title="Building Blocks" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/buildingblocks/">Building Blocks</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a title="Service Providers" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/serviceproviders/">Service Providers</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a title="Tools" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/tools/">Tools</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a title="Events" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/events/">Events</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>These content systems each have their own database, and are linked together by a central tagging system, and I have established relationships between each of the databases as necessary.<br /><br />v2.0 allows me to store data I gather from around the web in a more structured way, &nbsp;one that allows me to identify patterns and trends easier and also opens up more opportunities for discovery here on the site.<br /><br />I have a whole bunch of APIs, tools, services etc. to put into the system, but I couldn't wait anymore and wanted to launch the new site. &nbsp;If you see any problems, <a title="let me know" href="../../contact.php">let me know please</a>.&nbsp;</p>
