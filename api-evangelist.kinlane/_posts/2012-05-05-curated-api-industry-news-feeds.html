<p>In my <a title="Google Reader" href="http://www.google.com/reader/">Google Reader</a> I curate hundreds of articles pulled from 600+ blogs and 25+ real-time Google Alerts, on a daily basis.  Everything I star in my Google Reader or Tweet about daily ends up in my <a title="Pinboard" href="http://pinboard.in/">Pinboard</a> account.  In addition to this curation, I bookmark every relevant site and post I come across in my daily surfing using the Pinboard bookmarklet.</p>
<p>Using the <a title="Pinboard API" href="http://pinboard.in/api/">Pinboard API</a> I setup a news curation system at <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> which pulls my latest pinboards every 15 minutes and adds them to a curation queue which I monitor every couple hours.  My API Evangelist curation system allows me to add comments and tags, further adding meaning to what I&rsquo;ve already read throughout the day. Then using a combinations of tags, I route relevant news to&nbsp; <a title="API Evangelist" href="/news/">API Evangelist</a> and <a title="Hack Weekend News" href="http://www.hackweekends.com/news/">Hack Weekends</a>.</p>
<p>These curated links represent the daily reading and research that goes into my writing and industry reports.  I thought it would be good to share with you some of what I read on a daily basis, my random comments and insights, rather than just the final results.</p>
