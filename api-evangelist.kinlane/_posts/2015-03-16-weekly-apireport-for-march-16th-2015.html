<p>Phew!! This week was hard. I just couldn't find the mojo to plow through, but I did it. A little late on Monday evening, but still so worth doing--putting the week into perspective.</p>
<p>I'm still trying to assess the best balance with what I post as individual news stories on <a href="http://api.report">API.Report</a>. I think more of this could be pulled out as actual news stories, but will have to see if I have the time. Overall I am happy with how the weekly API.Report is evolving, but there is so much more I could do.</p>
<p><span>The Weekly API.Report represents the best of what I've read throughout the week, and is only what I personally felt should be showcased. Each news item comes with a link, and some thoughts I had after curating the piece of API related news. I'm trying to break down stories into as coherent buckets as I can, but it remains something that is ever changing for me, but ultimately I will settle on a clear definition for each of the research areas.</span></p>
<p>I track on a lot of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3D Printing</span></strong>, but few of them are directly API related, finallky one that moves the conversation forward:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://sandhill.com/article/internet-of-things-and-3d-printing-creating-paradigm-shift-in-field-service-management/">Internet of Things and 3D Printing Creating Paradigm Shift in Field Service Management</a> - Interesting convergence of the Internet of Things and 3D Printing, showing the potential, on the ground around 3D printing.

<p>A story I did on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>spreadsheets</strong></span>, sparked some interesting discussions, and finds this week:</p>

<p>That concludes my report on what I read last week across the API space. I'm still working on pulling together a summary e-newsletter version, allowing people to get an executive summary of what I thought was important from the week--I am hoping it will be available next week. I'm also going to auto-generate some visualizations, and summary counts for each week. I'd like to see a tag cloud, and overall counts to help me understand the scope of news I cover each week.</p>
<p>As I did last week, I'm walking away with a better awareness of what is happening across the space. It isn't enough for me to read all of this API news in isolation, it helps to see it side by side with other news, allowing me to see and understand patterns that I may have missed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for reading. ;-)</p>
