<p>I'm working a wider campaign focused on getting my shit together around my images, and part of that is continueing work I had started with my <a href="http://screen-capture.apievangelist.com/">screen capture API</a>, and launch more image manipulation API resources.</p>
<p>I have a wide range of needs to resize, crop, filter, and apply other filters to photos I work with, as part of my storytelling, and if I had a set of image manipulation APIs, life would be better--so as I do with anything, I got to work building an API.</p>
<p>The result is the first, in a series of&nbsp;<a href="http://image.manipulation.apievangelist.com/">image manipulation APIs</a>. Right now I focused on some low hanging fruit, like applying filters to images, which includes Charcoal, Oil Painting, Polaroid, and Sketch. Next, I will tackle some more utility APIs like resize, crop, and rotate.</p>
<p>Like my other APIs, I will use my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/17/an-operational-harness-for-my-screen-capture-api/">operational harness</a>, and operate a <a href="https://apievangelist.3scale.net/">cloud version of my image manipulation API</a>, where anyone can access, and take advantage of my API resources. Using my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/14/service-composition-for-my-screen-capture-api/">API service composition</a>, I setup access tiers for public, partners and internal usage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will also open source any code behind so that others can deploy image manipulation within their own infrastructure, or I'm happy to setup for you--for a fee! :-)</p>
<p>I have a number of APIs I want to get built, and image manipulation has been on my list for a while, I'm glad I finally was able to get this work started.</p>
