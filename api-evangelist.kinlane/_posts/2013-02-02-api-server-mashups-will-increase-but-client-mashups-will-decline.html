<p>Master API architect at <a title="Layer7 Technologies" href="http://www.layer7tech.com/">Layer7 Technologies</a> Mike Amundsen (<a href="https://twitter.com/mamund" target="_blank">@mamund</a>) has a great post this week on <a href="http://www.layer7tech.com/blogs/index.php/four-tech-related-trends-that-will-shape-2013/" target="_blank">Four Tech-Related Trends That Will Shape 2013</a>.</p>
<p>One of the predictions that caught my eye was that "server mash-ups will increase but client mash-ups will decline"--he clarifies it with:</p>
<blockquote><em>The increasing popularity of languages like Node.js, Erlang and Closure will make implementing server-side mash-ups more efficient and easier to maintain than doing the same work within a client application; especially for the mobile platform. This will reduce the &ldquo;chattiness&rdquo; of client-side applications and increase the security and flexibility of server-side implementations. The result will be a perceived increase in responsiveness and a reduced use of battery power on mobile apps.</em></blockquote>
<p>As with my earlier post, <a title="individual API deployments will get smaller and more numerous" href="/2013/02/02/the-scientific-archive-of-biodiversity-audio-and-video-recordings-needs-an-api/">individual API deployments will get smaller and more numerous</a>, I agree 100%.  This is where I&rsquo;m going with my post this week on <a title="Virtual API Stacks" href="/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">virtual API stacks</a>.  With so many individual resources available on the web, in the coming years we&rsquo;ll see increased &ldquo;mashing up&rdquo; or &ldquo;virtualization&rdquo; of new stacks, that are meaningful to a particular app or group of developers.</p>
<p>An example of this in the wild is&nbsp;<a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a>, with their API aggregation or mashup, which is available as a service, but is also <a href="https://github.com/Singly/hallway">available as open source on Github as Hallway</a>.  Another recent example is potentially the <a title="OpenKit Gaming BaaS" href="/2013/02/01/new-open-source-backend-as-a-services-platform-for-game-developers/">OpenKit Gaming BaaS</a>, which promised to be an open stack designed for game developers.</p>
<p>My predication is we&rsquo;ll see many more returns from server side API mashups, than we did during the client side mashup gold rush days! &nbsp;Especially if providers open source these stacks, while also offering as a service.</p>
