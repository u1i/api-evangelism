     <a title="Rapportive" href="http://rapportive.com/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/rapportive/rapportive-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     When new developers register for the <a title="CityGrid APIs" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/">CityGrid API</a>, I get an email with their name and email address. I want to make sure each developer knows I’m here, and available to help them get up and running as quick as possible.
</p>
<p>
     Emailing them as soon as they register seems a little too pushy, but following them on Twitter, with <a title="my personal Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/#!/kinlane">my personal Twitter</a> and the <a title="CityGrid API Twitter Account" href="https://twitter.com/#!/CityGridAPITeam">CityGrid API Twitter account</a> makes sense. So how do I get their Twitter handle, without spending too much time and derailing whatever I’m working on?
</p>
<p>
     In comes <a title="Rapportive" href="http://rapportive.com/">Rapportive</a>. For those of you who don’t know what Rapportive is, it is an browser add-on that runs in my Gmail and shows me everything about a contact I’m emailing with. On the right hand side it lists as much information associated with the email as the service can find, such as Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn.
</p>
<p>
     So when I get a new registration email from CityGrid APIs, I highlight the email address and it shows me information about the user. Many users don’t maintain active online profiles, so it returns nothing. However a handful, have Twitter accounts associated, which I immediately follow with my personal and CityGrid API Twitter accounts.
</p>
<p>
     Both of my Twitter profiles clearly reflect <a title="CityGrid APIs" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/">CityGrid APIs</a>, so when I follow them on Twitter, my developers know who I am, and they should now be aware that I am here to help. If they have any questions, they know they know how to find me.
