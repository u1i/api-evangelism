<p>I have a workflow for dealing with the steady stream of ideas that fly out of my arse on a daily basis.  First, I write them all down in Evernote.  If an idea sticks with me and keeps nagging on me in the back of my mind, I usually give it a place on the internal wiki that I use for managing my world.  Then if an idea sits on the wiki for over a year and I haven&rsquo;t finished building it, and successfully deployed or integrated into my platform--I set it free.</p>
<p>The one year expiration date has come for one of my ideas, and I want to publish here so maybe someone else will run with it.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Project Idea:</strong> RESTGit</li>
<li><strong>Summary:</strong> A RESTful interface for any public or private Github repository.</li>
</ul>
<p>I just want a quick way of throwing up a RESTful front, with or without authentication using <a title="3Scale API management" href="http://www.3scale.net">3Scale API management</a>. RESTGit would deploy any flavor of language I choose: PHP, Python, Ruby, Java or anything else.</p>
<p>This way I could take select code resources I possess, commit them to a Github repository--then point RESTGit at the repository, and it would generate a REST framework and allow me to customize and adjust as needed.</p>
<p>RESTGit would be open source of course.  It could be deployed as an Amazon EC2 instance, letting me rapidly deliver APIs for any resources I posses and scale as needed using AWS.</p>
<p>I wish I had more time to invest in my side projects, but I&rsquo;d rather see it implemented.  Hopefully one of you readers will find the time to develop RESTGit and open source it for everyone to use.</p>
