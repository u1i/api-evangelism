<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/apache/apache-logo.png" align="right" width="30%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>I'm spending time investing in [my data](http://data.apievangelist.com), as well as [my database API research](http://database.apievangelist.com). I'll have guides, with accompanying stories coming out over the next couple weeks, but I want to take a moment to publish some of the raw research that I think paints an interesting picture about where things are headed.

When studying what is going on with data and APIs you can't do any search without stumbling across an Apache project doing something or other with data. [I found 37 separate projects at Apache that were data related](https://projects.apache.org/projects.html?category), and wanted to publish as a single list I could learn from.

- [**Airvata****](https://projects.apache.org/project.html?airavata) - Apache Airavata is a micro-service architecture based software framework for executing and managing computational jobs and workflows on distributed computing resources including local clusters, supercomputers, national grids, academic and commercial clouds. Airavata is dominantly used to build Web-based science gateways and assist to compose, manage, execute, and monitor large scale applications (wrapped as Web services) and workflows composed of these services.
- [**Ambari**](https://projects.apache.org/project.html?ambari) - Apache Ambari makes Hadoop cluster provisioning, managing, and monitoring dead simple.
- [**Apex**](https://projects.apache.org/project.html?apex) - Apache Apex is a unified platform for big data stream and batch processing. Use cases include ingestion, ETL, real-time analytics, alerts and real-time actions. Apex is a Hadoop-native YARN implementation and uses HDFS by default. It simplifies development and productization of Hadoop applications by reducing time to market. Key features include Enterprise Grade Operability with Fault Tolerance, State Management, Event Processing Guarantees, No Data Loss, In-memory Performance & Scalability and Native Window Support.
- [**Avro**](https://projects.apache.org/project.html?avro) - Apache Avro is a data serialization system.
- [**Beam**](https://projects.apache.org/project.html?beam) - Apache Beam is a unified programming model for both batch and streaming data processing, enabling efficient execution across diverse distributed execution engines and providing extensibility points for connecting to different technologies and user communities.
- [**Bigtop**](https://projects.apache.org/project.html?bigtop) - Bigtop is a project for the development of packaging and tests of the Apache Hadoop ecosystem. The primary goal of Bigtop is to build a community around the packaging and interoperability testing of Hadoop-related projects. This includes testing at various levels (packaging, platform, runtime, upgrade, etc...) developed by a community with a focus on the system as a whole, rather than individual projects. In short we strive to be for Hadoop what Debian is to Linux.
- [**BookKeeper**](https://projects.apache.org/project.html?bookkeeper) - BookKeeper is a reliable replicated log service. It can be used to turn any standalone service into a highly available replicated service. BookKeeper is highly available (no single point of failure), and scales horizontally as more storage nodes are added.
- [**Calcite**](https://projects.apache.org/project.html?calcite) - Calcite is a framework for writing data management systems. It converts queries, represented in relational algebra, into an efficient executable form using pluggable query transformation rules. There is an optional SQL parser and JDBC driver. Calcite does not store data or have a preferred execution engine. Data formats, execution algorithms, planning rules, operator types, metadata, and cost model are added at runtime as plugins.
- [**CouchDB**](https://projects.apache.org/project.html?couchdb) - Apache CouchDB is a database that completely embraces the web. Store your data with JSON documents. Access your documents with your web browser, via HTTP. Query, combine, and transform your documents with JavaScript. Apache CouchDB works well with modern web and mobile apps. You can even serve web apps directly out of Apache CouchDB. And you can distribute your data, or your apps, efficiently using Apache CouchDBâ€™s incremental replication. Apache CouchDB supports master-master setups with automatic conflict detection.
- [**Crunch**](https://projects.apache.org/project.html?crunch) - The Apache Crunch Java library provides a framework for writing, testing, and running MapReduce pipelines. Its goal is to make pipelines that are composed of many user-defined functions simple to write, easy to test, and efficient to run.
- [**DataFu**](https://projects.apache.org/project.html?datafu) - Apache DataFu consists of two libraries: Apache DataFu Pig is a collection of useful user-defined functions for data analysis in Apache Pig. Apache DataFu Hourglass is a library for incrementally processing data using Apache Hadoop MapReduce. This library was inspired by the prevalence of sliding window computations over daily tracking data. Computations such as these typically happen at regular intervals (e.g. daily, weekly), and therefore the sliding nature of the computations means that much of the work is unnecessarily repeated. DataFu's Hourglass was created to make these computations more efficient, yielding sometimes 50-95% reductions in computational resources.
- [**Drill**](https://projects.apache.org/project.html?drill) - Apache Drill is a distributed MPP query layer that supports SQL and alternative query languages against NoSQL and Hadoop data storage systems. It was inspired in part by Google's Dremel.
- [**Edgent**](https://projects.apache.org/project.html?edgent) - Apache Edgent is a programming model and micro-kernel style runtime that can be embedded in gateways and small footprint edge devices enabling local, real-time, analytics on the continuous streams of data coming from equipment, vehicles, systems, appliances, devices and sensors of all kinds (for example, Raspberry Pis or smart phones). Working in conjunction with centralized analytic systems, Apache Edgent provides efficient and timely analytics across the whole IoT ecosystem: from the center to the edge.
- [**Falcon**](https://projects.apache.org/project.html?falcon) - Apache Falcon is a data processing and management solution for Hadoop designed for data motion, coordination of data pipelines, lifecycle management, and data discovery. Falcon enables end consumers to quickly onboard their data and its associated processing and management tasks on Hadoop clusters.
- [**Flink**](https://projects.apache.org/project.html?flink) - Flink is an open source system for expressive, declarative, fast, and efficient data analysis. It combines the scalability and programming flexibility of distributed MapReduce-like platforms with the efficiency, out-of-core execution, and query optimization capabilities found in parallel databases.
- [**Flume**](https://projects.apache.org/project.html?flume) - Apache Flume is a distributed, reliable, and available system for efficiently collecting, aggregating and moving large amounts of log data from many different sources to a centralized data store
- [**Giraph**](https://projects.apache.org/project.html?giraph) - Apache Giraph is an iterative graph processing system built for high scalability. For example, it is currently used at Facebook to analyze the social graph formed by users and their connections.
- [**Hama**](https://projects.apache.org/project.html?hama) - The Apache Hama is an efficient and scalable general-purpose BSP computing engine which can be used to speed up a large variety of compute-intensive analytics applications.
- [**Helix**](https://projects.apache.org/project.html?helix) - Apache Helix is a generic cluster management framework used for the automatic management of partitioned, replicated and distributed resources hosted on a cluster of nodes. Helix automates reassignment of resources in the face of node failure and recovery, cluster expansion, and reconfiguration.
- [**Ignite**](https://projects.apache.org/project.html?ignite) - Apache Ignite In-Memory Data Fabric is designed to deliver uncompromised performance for a wide set of in-memory computing use cases from high performance computing, to the industry most advanced data grid, in-memory SQL, in-memory file system, streaming, and more.
- [**Kafka**](https://projects.apache.org/project.html?kafka) - A single Kafka broker can handle hundreds of megabytes of reads and writes per second from thousands of clients. Kafka is designed to allow a single cluster to serve as the central data backbone for a large organization. It can be elastically and transparently expanded without downtime. Data streams are partitioned and spread over a cluster of machines to allow data streams larger than the capability of any single machine and to allow clusters of co-ordinated consumers. Kafka has a modern cluster-centric design that offers strong durability and fault-tolerance guarantees. Messages are persisted on disk and replicated within the cluster to prevent data loss. Each broker can handle terabytes of messages without performance impact.
- [**Knox**](https://projects.apache.org/project.html?knox) - The Apache Knox Gateway is a REST API Gateway for interacting with Hadoop clusters. The Knox Gateway provides a single access point for all REST interactions with Hadoop clusters. In this capacity, the Knox Gateway is able to provide valuable functionality to aid in the control, integration, monitoring and automation of critical administrative and analytical needs of the enterprise.
- [**Lens**](https://projects.apache.org/project.html?lens) - Lens provides an Unified Analytics interface. Lens aims to cut the Data Analytics silos by providing a single view of data across multiple tiered data stores and optimal execution environment for the analytical query. It seamlessly integrates Hadoop with traditional data warehouses to appear like one.
- [**MetaModel**](https://projects.apache.org/project.html?metamodel) - With MetaModel you get a uniform connector and query API to many very different datastore types, including: Relational (JDBC) databases, CSV files, Excel spreadsheets, XML files, JSON files, Fixed width files, MongoDB, Apache CouchDB, Apache HBase, Apache Cassandra, ElasticSearch, OpenOffice.org databases, Salesforce.com, SugarCRM and even collections of plain old Java objects (POJOs). MetaModel isn't a data mapping framework. Instead we emphasize abstraction of metadata and ability to add data sources at runtime, making MetaModel great for generic data processing applications, less so for applications modeled around a particular domain.
- [**Oozie**](https://projects.apache.org/project.html?oozie) - Oozie is a workflow scheduler system to manage Apache Hadoop jobs. Oozie is integrated with the rest of the Hadoop stack supporting several types of Hadoop jobs out of the box (such as Java map-reduce, Streaming map-reduce, Pig, Hive, Sqoop and Distcp) as well as system specific jobs (such as Java programs and shell scripts).
- [**ORC**](https://projects.apache.org/project.html?orc) - ORC is a self-describing type-aware columnar file format designed for Hadoop workloads. It is optimized for large streaming reads, but with integrated support for finding required rows quickly. Storing data in a columnar format lets the reader read, decompress, and process only the values that are required for the current query.
- [**Parquet**](https://projects.apache.org/project.html?parquet) - Apache Parquet is a general-purpose columnar storage format, built for Hadoop, usable with any choice of data processing framework, data model, or programming language.
- [**Phoenix**](https://projects.apache.org/project.html?phoenix) - Apache Phoenix enables OLTP and operational analytics for Apache Hadoop by providing a relational database layer leveraging Apache HBase as its backing store. It includes integration with Apache Spark, Pig, Flume, Map Reduce, and other products in the Hadoop ecosystem. It is accessed as a JDBC driver and enables querying, updating, and managing HBase tables through standard SQL.
- [**REEF**](https://projects.apache.org/project.html?reef) - Apache REEF (Retainable Evaluator Execution Framework) is a development framework that provides a control-plane for scheduling and coordinating task-level (data-plane) work on cluster resources obtained from a Resource Manager. REEF provides mechanisms that facilitate resource reuse for data caching, and state management abstractions that greatly ease the development of elastic data processing workflows on cloud platforms that support a Resource Manager service.
- [**Samza**](https://projects.apache.org/project.html?samza) - Apache Samza provides a system for processing stream data from publish-subscribe systems such as Apache Kafka. The developer writes a stream processing task, and executes it as a Samza job. Samza then routes messages between stream processing tasks and the publish-subscribe systems that the messages are addressed to.
- [**Spark**](https://projects.apache.org/project.html?spark) - Apache Spark is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing. It offers high-level APIs in Java, Scala and Python as well as a rich set of libraries including stream processing, machine learning, and graph analytics.
- [**Sqoop**](https://projects.apache.org/project.html?sqoop) - Apache Sqoop(TM) is a tool designed for efficiently transferring bulk data between Apache Hadoop and structured datastores such as relational databases.
- [**Storm**](https://projects.apache.org/project.html?storm) - Apache Storm is a distributed real-time computation system. Similar to how Hadoop provides a set of general primitives for doing batch processing, Storm provides a set of general primitives for doing real-time computation.
- [**Tajo**](https://projects.apache.org/project.html?tajo) - The main goal of Apache Tajo project is to build an advanced open source data warehouse system in Hadoop for processing web-scale data sets. Basically, Tajo provides SQL standard as a query language. Tajo is designed for both interactive and batch queries on data sets stored on HDFS and other data sources. Without hurting query response times, Tajo provides fault-tolerance and dynamic load balancing which are necessary for long-running queries. Tajo employs a cost-based and progressive query optimization techniques for optimizing running queries in order to avoid the worst query plans.
- [**Tez**](https://projects.apache.org/project.html?tez) - Apache Tez is an effort to develop a generic application framework which can be used to process arbitrarily complex directed-acyclic graphs (DAGs) of data-processing tasks and also a reusable set of data-processing primitives which can be used by other projects.
- [**VXQuery**](https://projects.apache.org/project.html?vxquery) - Apache VXQuery will be a standards compliant XML Query processor implemented in Java. The focus is on the evaluation of queries on large amounts of XML data. Specifically the goal is to evaluate queries on large collections of relatively small XML documents. To achieve this queries will be evaluated on a cluster of shared nothing machines.
- [**Zeppelin**](https://projects.apache.org/project.html?zeppelin) - Zeppelin is a modern web-based tool for the data scientists to collaborate over large-scale data exploration and visualization projects.

There is a serious amount of overlap between these projects. Not all of these projects have web APIs, while some of them are all about delivering a gateway or aggregate API across projects. There is a lot to process here, but I think listing them out provides an easier way to understand the big data explosion of projects over at Apache.

It is tough to understand what each of these do without actually playing with them, but that is something I just don't have the time to do, so next up I'll be doing independent searches for these project names, and finding stories from across the space regarding what folks are doing with these data solutions. That should give me enough to go on when putting them into specific buckets, and finding their place in my data, and database API research.
