This analysis is a summary of a paper by<a title="Seth Lewis" href="http://sethlewis.org/">Seth Lewis</a>, professor at University of Minnesota, and <a title="Tanja Altamurto" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tanja-aitamurto">Tanja Aitamurto</a>, a Finish PH.D student at Stanford, that was presented at the International Symposium on Online Journalism earlier this month.<p></p>
After studying the approaches of the four biggest players with open APIs are <a title="NPR" href="http://www.npr.org/api/index">NPR</a>, <a title="The New York Times" href="http://developer.nytimes.com/">The New York Times</a>, <a title="The Guardian" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/open-platform">The Guardian</a>, and <a title="USA Today" href="http://developer.usatoday.com/">USA Today</a>, Lewis and Aitamurto came away with five key lessons:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Open APIs can serve as external R&amp;D labs</li>
	<li>Open APIs present a revenue opportunity</li>
	<li>Open APIs help weave news organizations into the fabric of the web</li>
	<li>Open APIs create an ecosystem effect</li>
	<li>Open APIs can be a challenge, especially within the news organization</li>
</ul>
<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/journalism/the_guardian.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /> Lewis and Aitamurto conclude that Open APIs are not the solution to all of the news industries problems, but they are significant step toward a form of online publishing that is in sync with the web, and also allow publishers to take advantage of thewisdomof the (developer) crowd for research &amp; development.<p></p>
These new approaches offer a first glimpse of what <a title="Open Innovation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_innovation">open innovation</a> using APIs could bring to the news business when it comes to revenue and partnerships.<p></p>
