<p>I have done a lot of research lately on the <a title="API Service Provider" href="/serviceproviders/">API service provider</a> landscape.  My goal is to understand who provides API delivery and management services, what they offer and help API owners understand the differences.</p>
<p>I wrote a <a title="roundup of 11 of the API service providers" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/10/19/api-service-provider-roundup/">roundup of 11 of the API service providers on ProgrammableWeb</a> last week.  I feel like I have a pretty good grasp of all the providers, but of course a new one came out of the woodwork.</p>
<p>It wasn't a new API service provider like <a href="/serviceproviders/mashape.php">Mashape</a> or <a href="/2011/10/07/easy-api-development-with-apiary-io/">Apiary.io</a>, it is a veteran player in the space, <a title="Vordel" href="http://www.vordel.com/">Vordel</a>.  Vordel has been around for almost 10 years and I would consider them part of the old guard of service oriented architecture (SOA) and web services providers, that existed before web APIs were cool.</p>
<p>Vordel provides a range of products we recognize with enterprise API deployments including <a title="API Gateways" href="http://www.vordel.com/solutions/api_gateway2.html">API Gateways</a>, <a title="XML Firewalls" href="http://www.vordel.com/solutions/xml_firewall.html">XML firewalls</a> and <a title="XML accelerators" href="http://www.vordel.com/solutions/xml_accelerator.html">accelerators</a>.  Vordel specializes in the legacy system connectors that are needed to bring existing enterprise systems into the new web API game.</p>
<p>The Vordel API Gateway compares to what I've seen from <a title="Layer7" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/06/17/layer-7-technologies-launches-new-api-portal/">Layer7</a> and <a title="SOA Software" href="/2011/06/17/atmosphere-a-new-api-management-portal/">SOA Software</a>, with the following key features:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/vordel/Vordel-API-Gateway.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Protocol translation for REST and SOAP</li>
<li>Versioning and lifecycle management</li>
<li>Caching of frequently used calls</li>
<li>Monitor, log and audit usage</li>
<li>Secure API from threats</li>
<li>Service level agreements (SLA)</li>
</ul>
<p>Vordel has an impressive client list including the FBI, Coast Guard and Dunn &amp; Bradstreet, and delivers some progressive integrations, like a deployment of their API gateway for <a title="Blackhawk Network" href="http://www.blackhawknetwork.com/">Blackhawk Network</a>, which extends REST services to their business partners like iTunes and Facebook.</p>
<p>I see all the hardened enterprise services I've seen with existing providers, I think why they may have missed my radar is they lack the open API building blocks like developer portals, app showcases, forums and the self-service partner systems I tend to track on.</p>
<p>Vordel is new to me, it will take some more time to get to know their products and team like I have with existing API management service providers.  As I learn more about Vordel I will share more information about the company, the services they offer, and what makes them stand out from existing landscape of <a title="API Service Providers" href="/serviceproviders/">API service providers</a>.</p>
