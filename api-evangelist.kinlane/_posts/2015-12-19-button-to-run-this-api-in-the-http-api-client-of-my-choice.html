<p>There are more <a href="http://client.apievangelist.com/companies.html">HTTP client tools</a> out there than I can shake a stick at (I've reached that point, I'm shaking sticks at things), and in 2016 I predict there will be even more entrants into the space. <a href="http://apis.how/gwbjyujag1">I'd say Postman was a pioneering force in the evolution of the HTTP client when it comes for web API space</a>, but is <a href="http://apis.how/ohgw3uqjt0">something that it is beginning to collide with API design tooling from Apiary</a>, as well as being <a href="http://apis.how/syulwzictt">morphed by new players like Stoplight.io</a>.</p>
<p>Maybe I am playing with more of these environments than the average API consumer is, because of what I do for a living, but I have to say, I am getting tired of "importing" my API definitions. Don't me wrong. I am stoked that all tools support the importing of <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">machine readable API definitions like OADF, and API Blueprint</a>, but I cannot help&nbsp;always looking to what should be next, and I want to be able to just run each API, in my HTTP client of my choice.</p>
<p><a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/api/">For all of my own APIs, I provide a Postman icon, and link to a Postman Collection</a>. It just gives you quick access to the machine readable currency that all services I depend on speak, OADF, API Blueprint, and Postman Collection. However, I still have to import it into Postman, or other HTTP API client, or service I will be using. While this is a good start, and is something I recommend other API providers do, I think we can still do better.</p>
<p>If you are operating one of the HTTP API clients, or <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/04/api-client-tool-garage-hub-playground-studio-workbench-and-builders/">planning one of the next generation&nbsp;API cleints, tools, garage, hub, playground, studio, workbench, or builder</a>, can you please provide a "run in XXXX" embeddable button please? I would like to see pretty little icons throughout API portals, and the service providers we depend on across the API space, that empower me run any API via the client I depend on every day.</p>
<p>Think the Twitter and Facebook share buttons, but for API integration, and the currency is OADF and API Blueprint definitions. I appreciate all you HTTP API client providers considering my crazy requests. If done right, I think it could result in some potential new users, depending how you'd handle the process for users who clicked, but didn't actually have an account with your platform yet--anyway, food for thought. #onward</p>
