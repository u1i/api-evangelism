<p>I was reviewing one of the many entries in my review queue of companies who are doing interesting things with APIs, and stumbled across the data visualization API&mdash;<a href="http://lightning-viz.org/">Lightning</a>. Their implementation grabs my attention on several fronts, but their focus on delivering their API within your own infrastructure via a Heroku button, is one of the most relevant aspects.</p>
<p>This approach reflects a seismic shift occurring in how we deploy APIs, and how we deploy architecture overall.  You need a <a href="http://lightning-viz.org/">data visualization API</a>, let me deploy my API into your cloud, or on-premise infrastructure using popular approaches to virtualization&mdash;developers do not need to go to the API, the API will now come to you, and live within your existing infrastructure stack.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been talking about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/07/a-wholesale-onpremise-version-of-my-api-for-sale/">wholesale APIs a lot lately,</a> showcasing the<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/26/a-peek-at-the-future-with-white-label-apis/"> white label approach by some API providers</a>, and <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/blog/">exploring within the evolution of my own infrastructure</a>, and as more savvy API providers jump in on this opportunity, you&rsquo;ll see more stories emerge trying to understand the shift going on. <a href="http://lightning-viz.org/">Lightning</a> is accomplishing this with Heroku, and their embeddable button, but companies who embrace a containerized micro-service centered approach to API deployment, will have a wide open playing field for buying and selling of the wholesale API driven technology being deployed across the emerging API economy.</p>
