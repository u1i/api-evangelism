<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/dwolla-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />The <a title="Dwolla" href="https://www.dwolla.com">Dwolla payment service</a> just <a title="launched a new payment network called Grid" href="http://www.dwolla.org/blog/grid-is-here-cash-just-got-more-secure-than-plastic/">launched a new payment API called Grid</a>. Before you can understand grid, you need to understand Dwolla'sphilosophyon payments.
<p></p>Every time you want to do seemingly simple things, like buy a coffee, pay for lunch, or buy gas, current providers are requiring you hand over your name, credit card number, and expiration date, leaving trail of personal and financial data behind you.
<p></p>With an opportunity to start fresh, Dwolla wanted to change this, and thats what they are doing with Grid.
<p></p>Grid provides third party developers tools to create a seamless in-app purchasing experience with no more credit card numbers. Creating a new kind of payment network, one that doesn't leave behind personal information.
<p></p><strong>Why is this huge for consumers?</strong>
<p></p>This new network puts consumers, not networks, in control of who can access, their payment information, allowing users to revoke and modify who can access their payment network.
<p></p><strong>Why this is huge for merchants?</strong>
<p></p>Merchants can get paid online without the recurring costs associated with other networks, and accept payments with Dwolla's regular merchant account and pay no special account fees.
<p></p><strong>Why this is huge for developers?</strong>
<p></p><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/internet-payment-transactions.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />For the first time ever, developers will have access to a payment network to innovate and build on top of, that removes a lot of liability that is typically associated with credit card networks.
<p></p>I tend to only focus on stories around innovative approaches to the business of APIs, which usually means how an API is delivered. Another area that I enjoy covering is how businesses are using APIs to change entire industries. Dwolla fits this profile.
<p></p>Dwolla is taking on an industry that is extremely complex, full of holes and was not build with the Internet in mind. Providing a simple web interface, an API, and flat pricing model, they are reinventing how we do payments from the ground up.
<p></p>Dwolla provides a REST and SOAP API, and employ OAuth for authentication. You can find more about their API in their <a title="developers area" href="https://www.dwolla.com/dev/">developers area</a>.
<p></p>Dwolla is free for anyone to use, and charges a flat .25 per transaction. Thats it.
