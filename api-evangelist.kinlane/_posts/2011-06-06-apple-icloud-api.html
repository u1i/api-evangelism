</p>
<p>
     There were major enhancements coming down the pipes with IOS 5 and Mac OS X Lion. What really stood out was their new <a title="iCloud" href="http://www.apple.com/icloud/">iCloud</a>.
</p>
<p>
     iCloud is free, seamless storage in the cloud for all music, photos, books, documents and everything else you use on your Mac and IOS devices.
</p>
<p>
     Although this line of thought is nothing new, with Apple going all in…it means the cloud has gone mainstream.
</p>
<p>
     Get ready for some major growth in the cloud as Apple pushes it further, and other existing cloud providers try to compete.
