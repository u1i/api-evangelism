<p>There have been many advances in the way that we deploy APIs in the last couple of years, but I still want more of an embeddable, push botton way to deploy generic or even more specialized APIs. This is something I've ranted about before, <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/09/12/where-is-the-deploy-to-aws-and-google-button/">asking where the deploy to AWS and Google buttons</a>. I'm seeing more AWS solutions emerge, <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/09/12/where-is-the-deploy-to-aws-and-google-button/">helping deploy from Github using AWS Codeploy</a>, and the regular number of deploy to Heroku buttons, but not the real growth I'd like to see occur--making it a drum I will keep beating&nbsp;until I get what I want.</p>
<p>I was working <a href="http://openapi.toolbox.apievangelist.com/">on my OpenAPI toolbox</a>, cataloging <a href="http://openapi.toolbox.apievangelist.com/">open source tools that put the OpenAPI specification to work</a>, and came across a deploy with Heroku button for the <a href="https://github.com/sethherr/grape-doorkeeper/">Grape Doorkeeper</a>, which helps you<em> "create an awesome versioned API, secured with OAuth2 and automatically documented"</em>. This should be the&nbsp;default for all server-side API deployment frameworks, allowing push button deployment of any open source API framework to the cloud platform of your choosing.</p>
<p>If I have my way, it won't just be API frameworks that will have deployment buttons. Specialized API designs, available in a variety of frameworks will be available for deployment with a single click of a button. We should be able to deploy a product API, or a user API, to AWS, Heroku, Google, or Microsoft, with a single click. There should be a wealth of open source templates for us to choose from on Github, with deploy buttons, and easy to follow wizards that help us set things up properly.</p>
<p>Smells like an opportunity to me. I'll have to think more about where the revenue would come from in such a model, but I'm sure it would be easy enough to upsell deployments to some premium features and services. I understand that both the areas of API design and API deployment are playing catch-up with API management at the moment, but someone needs to get to work on streamlining the API deployment button experience across all major cloud platforms&nbsp;and get to work on crafting some useful API server deployments that people can put to work instantly. #please #thankyou</p>
