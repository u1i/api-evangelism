<p>The team over at <a href="https://whatspossible.johnsoncontrols.com/community/panoptix">Panoptix</a> turned me on to the the <a href="https://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/commercial/seed_platform.html">Standard Energy Efficiency Data (SEED)</a> platform being developed over at the Department of Energy, which aims to be an API for collecting, storing and analyzing building energy performance data.</p>
<p>It appears that DOE is looking to develop open source software that state and local governments can use to manage energy efficiency across their buildings.</p>
<p>I like the approach to develop an open source, API driven platform that can set the tone for how data can be collected, managed, and shared. I think this is a great way to lead in an industry, and bring together not just government entities but other private sector players.</p>
<p>SEED is something I&rsquo;d love to see work, and an API design I&rsquo;d love to see in the <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>. If you are part of the SEED project, I&rsquo;d love to talk more. I pinged the email on the site, but haven&rsquo;t heard anything.</p>
<p>Good stuff coming out of DOE lately.</p>
