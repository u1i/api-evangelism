<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/facebook/Facebook-Games.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />Tomorrow I'm participating in a session at <a title="Gluecon called Finishing School for Potential API Providers" href="http://gluecon.com/2011/?page_id=16">Gluecon called Finishing School for Potential API Providers</a>.
<p></p><a title="Justin Tormey" href="http://twitter.com/#!/justintormey">Justin Tormey</a> of Alcatel-Lucent will be talking some about segmentation of API developers to focus on the different types personalities wtihin an API ecosystem.
<p></p>Focusing outside of Gluecon for a moment, Facebook has been doing a good job of this type of platform segmentation. Yesterday they launched <a title="facebook + Games" href="http://www.facebook.com/fbandgames">Facebook + Games</a>, a page created for the the Facebook games partner and business community. The Facebook Page will focus on social gaming innovation, directly from the Facebook Games Partnerships Team.
<p></p>I wrote about the the <a title="Journalist on Facebook" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/17/beyond-partners-and-developers-with-your-api/">Journalist on Facebook</a> page last month, and how Facebook is targeting media and journalist with a similar Facebook Partner Platform page. This was another example of their API platform segmentation.
<p></p>This type of segmentation is key to success within a growing developer ecosystem, not all developers are created equal. Make sure you identify the differences within your community, and provide resources targeted to these gorups.
