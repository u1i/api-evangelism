<p>I'm just going to keep putting my ideas out there, so that y'all will build what is needed for the API space. In support of my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/25/if-i-could-design-my-perfect-api-design-editor/">API design tool</a>, and my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/24/someone-please-build-my-open-interactive-portable-and-visual-api-documentation-toolkit/">interactive API documentation tool</a>, I want a <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> generated visualization layer for APIs, using <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js.</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m envisioning a whole marketplace of visualizations I can choose from, driven from various popular APIs like Twitter, Crunchbase, OpenCorporates, and much more. There are number of proprietary data visualizations tools emerging out there (I&rsquo;m watching you), but what I'm looking for is specifically an open solution using D3.js.</p>
<p>I don't have a problem if there are premium layers, and features that are driven by commercial APIs, or there being added charges for API consumption in general, but I want the visualization, and underlying JSON to be open and configurable&mdash;encouraging access and re-use.</p>
<p>It can be tough to help people understand just exactly what an API is, and I feel like an open visualization layer using <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a>, driven from <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> would be one of the quickest ways to help people understand exactly what value an API can deliver.</p>
