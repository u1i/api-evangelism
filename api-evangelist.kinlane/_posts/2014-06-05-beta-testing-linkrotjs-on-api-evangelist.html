<p>I started beta testing a new JavaScript library, combined with API, that I&rsquo;m calling linkrot.js. My goal is to address link rot across my blogs. There are two main reasons links are bad on my site, either I moved the page or resource, or a website or other resource has gone away.</p>
<p>To help address this problem, I wrote a simple JavaScript file that lives in the footer of my blog, and when the page loads, it spiders all the links on the page, combining them into a single list and then makes a call to the linkrot.js API.</p>
<p>All new links will get a URL shortener applied, as well as a screenshot taken of the page. Every night a script will run to check the HTTP status of each link used in my site&mdash;verifying the page exists, and is a valid link.</p>
<p>Every time link rot.js loads, it will spider the links available in the page, sync with linkrot.js API, and the API returns the corresponding shortened URL, or if a link shows a 404 status, the link will no longer link to page, it will popup the last screenshot of the page, identifying the page no longer exists.</p>
<p>Eventually I will be developing a dashboard, allowing me to manage the link rot across my websites, make suggestions on links I can fix, provides a visual screen capture of those I cannot, while also adding a new analytics layer by implementing shortened URLs.</p>
<p>Linkrot.js is just an internal tool I&rsquo;m developing in private beta. Once I get up and running, Audrey will beta test, and we&rsquo;ll see where it goes from there. Who knows!</p>
