<p>API <a href="https://zapier.com">interoperability and reciprocity provider Zapier</a> is looking to get everyone up to speed on the world of APIs, by providing an <a href="https://zapier.com/learn/apis/">introduction to APIs</a> that is meant for both developers who are new to APIs, and easy enough for non-developers to follow.</p>
<p>To help get people up to speed on APIs, Zapier&rsquo;s introduction has eight chapters covering the big picture:</p>

<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Chapter 1: Introduction</li>
<li>Chapter 2: Protocols</li>
<li>Chapter 3: Data Formats</li>
<li>Chapter 4: Authentication, Part 1</li>
<li>Chapter 5: Authentication, Part 2</li>
<li>Chapter 6: API Design</li>
<li>Chapter 7: Real-Time Communication</li>
<li>Chapter 8: Implementation</li>
</ul>
<p>It is good to see providers like Zapier develop an introductory course for people to learn about APIs. It is in Zapier&rsquo;s interest to help get people up to speed&mdash;the more folks who understand that APIs exist, the more chance they will use Zapier as the platform they depend on to orchestrate their lives in the cloud.</p>
<p>Zapier&rsquo;s move reflects my original vision behind API Evangelist, and my belief that everyone should understand APIs, and I mean everyone! <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/17/api-and-oauth-literacy-is-as-important-as-financial-literacy-in-the-api-economy/">Much like personal finance, not everyone needs to understand the inner workings of APIs, but every individual should understand they exist</a>, and how they can use services like Zapier to take control of our digital self.</p>
