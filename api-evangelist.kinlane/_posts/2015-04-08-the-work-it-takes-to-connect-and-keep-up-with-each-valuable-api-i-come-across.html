<p>If I find a new company during my research, it takes me about a minimum of 15 minutes to lightly profile what they are up, and add to my system, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/06/my-ideal-profile-of-companies-who-are-doing-interesting-things-with-apis/">if I do a full profile</a>, it can take several hours. All of this adds up to a lot of work, time that would be better spent on actually writing stories, hacking on the APIs, and publishing of the longer form research papers on what I&rsquo;m seeing.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, <a href="http://apisjson.org/">each of these APIs would have an APIs.json in the root of their domain</a>, with details about the company and people responsible for API operations, and as much information about each API as possible. With a single click, I could import the entire profile of a company, and its valuable API resources into my monitoring system, ready for publishing to relevant areas of the API Evangelist network, as well as some of my partner sites like <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>--the beauty is, so could anyone else. ;-)</p>
<p>If API providers used <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a>, I could be connected to their Blog via RSS, their platform Twitter account via the Twitter API, and their Github profile or organization using the Github API. Not only would I have relevant metadata about a company like their name, description, logo, and details about APIs, I would also be connected to a real-time heartbeat of API operations via the platform blog, Twitter, and Github accounts. This is just the start--there are numerous other building blocks you could wire up with an APIs.json file, to keep potential consumers up to speed.</p>
<p>I know it can be hard to se the potential for APIs.json, because there is limiting tooling available currently, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/03/an-open-source-distributed-api-search-engine/">beyond the open source search engine APIs.io</a>, Even before the next wave of tooling like the internal enterprise search engine, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/23/i-got-swaggered-last-week-and-now-i-am-seeing-api-visualizations/">visualizations</a>, <a href="https://github.com/chefArchitect/apispots">browser plugins</a>, and other tooling are available, you can realize the benefit of being listed on <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>, and make sure you are fully plugged into my regular monitoring of the API space, which means the chances are much, much higher that I will write a story about what you, and your developers are up to. ;-)</p>
