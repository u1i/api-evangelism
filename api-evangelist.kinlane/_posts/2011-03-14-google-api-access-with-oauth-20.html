Even though the <a title="OAuth 2.0 Specification" href="http://wiki.oauth.net/w/page/25236487/OAuth-2">OAuth 2.0 specification</a> isn't 100% finalized, Google has overhauled all of their APIs in Google Code to support it.<p></p>
OAuth 2.0 is much easier for developers to implement, and simplifies OAuth consent for application users.<p></p>
Google's support for OAuth 2.0 is a big boost for developers integrating with their API, as well as big vote of support for the future of OAuth 2.0 as the standard for API authentication.<p></p>
You can find documentation for <a title="Oauth 2.0 for Google APIs" href="http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/docs/OAuth2.html">OAuth 2.0 underAuthentication and Authorization for Google APIs</a>.<p></p>
