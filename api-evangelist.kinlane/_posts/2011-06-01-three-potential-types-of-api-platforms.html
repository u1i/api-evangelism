<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/trojan-horse.gif" alt="" width="275" align="right" />I'm processing all my notes from the 2011 <a title="Glue Conference" href="http://gluecon.com/">Glue Conference</a>, which has been one of the most thought provoking events I've been to this year.<p></p>
The best part of events like Gluecon is you get to hang with some really smart and extremely experienced people.<p></p>
I'm working to understand a new perspective I was exposed to while listening to Mark Suster talk about the Cloud Computing: Challenges and Opportunities over the Next Five Years.<p></p>
In his talk, he outlined three potential types of platforms:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Platform as a Service </strong>- Platform around core application or business as an API, allowing others to build businesses on top of, and make money.</li>
	<li><strong>Platform as an Extension</strong> - Platform around a core application that offers APIs as an extension for others to build on bringing value back to the core business.</li>
	<li><strong>Platform as a Trojan Horse</strong> - Platform that allows others to build on, taking the risk, and the core business benefits from any value created.</li>
</ul>
As I work my way through the hundreds of available APIS I will definitely be applying what I'm learning...<p></p>
What is the motivation of each of these API platforms?
