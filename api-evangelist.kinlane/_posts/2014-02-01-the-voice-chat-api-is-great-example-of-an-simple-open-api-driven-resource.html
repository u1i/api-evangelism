<p>A free, open-source, API driven conference solution called <a href="http://voicechatapi.com/">Voice Chat API</a> popped up on my API monitoring radar today, as I was going through my feeds. The Voice Chat API is a very cool, dead-simple conferencing solution. As a tool it provides clear value, and I really like the approach from <a href="https://plivo.com/">Plivo</a> to rollout out an open, API driven resource like this&mdash;a model that could be applied to other valuable resources.</p>
<p>What really stands out is the Voice Chat API does one thing and does it well&mdash;audio conferences. It is easy to tell what it does. We aren't having to convince users of a problem, then sell them on a solution. The problem is clear, the solution is simple.</p>
<p><strong>Open Source</strong><br /> The <a href="https://github.com/plivo/voicechat/">Voice Chat API is open source and available on Github</a>, built using "Plivo WebSDK and APIs&rdquo;. I haven&rsquo;t investigated the separation between what code is open source, and where the dependencies on Plivo is, but regardless the approach is interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Add-Ons</strong><br /> Providing users with more ways to deploy a conference, the Voice Chat API provides a set of add-ons including a <a href="https://github.com/dhfromkorea/hubot-scripts/blob/master/src/scripts/voicechat.coffee/">Hubot Plugin</a>, that works in Campfire or Hipchat, a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/voice-chat/mmamadaodppejbaffaagddokjjekifoe">Chrome extension</a>, and a <a href="http://voicechatapi.com/create">bookmarklet for deploying a conference from any other browser</a>.</p>
<p><strong>API</strong><br /> The <a href="http://plivo.github.io/voicechat/">Voice Chat API centers around its API,&nbsp;</a>which allows developers to create a unique audio conference, the call mobile &amp; landline phone numbers (PSTN) into the bridge. The API deploys to your Heroku account, allowing you do manage your ad-hoc audio conference deployments in the cloud.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still playing around with the <a href="http://voicechatapi.com/">Voice Chat API</a>, understanding how the application and the API works, as well as considering how this new open source approach dovetails with Plivo's business model, but now I&rsquo;m intrigued which the approach, and how they crafted this API driven resource.</p>
