<p>I originally started writing this post after <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/">API Strategy &amp; Practice in Amsterdam</a>, where I had numerous conversations with banks, about the potential of APIs, and how banks might be starting to move from talk to action, when it comes to their API programs.</p>
<p>After recent talks with a couple more folks, behind the scenes at banks, I&rsquo;m pretty convinced, as the enterprise are doing in other sectors, banks are slowly waking up to the potential of APIs&mdash;something that has taken a long time, as they slowly come out of their bank vaults, where they were hiding during the economic meltdown.</p>
<p>When you Google the phase "<a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=banking%20api">banking API</a>", you see the signs that the space is ripe for disruption with APIs from two open banking pioneers:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://openbankproject.com/en/"><strong>The Open Bank Projec</strong>t</a> - an open source API and App store for banks that empowers financial institutions to securely and rapidly enhance their digital offerings using an ecosystem of 3rd party applications and services</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://plaid.com/">Plaid</a></strong> - The Modern API for Banking Data, allowing developers to programmatically interact with banks and credit cards</li>
</ul>
<p>These players do not represent movement from the banking space itself, the conversation I&rsquo;ve had with Visa, Mastercard, Capital One, Rabobank, and others I can&rsquo;t even mention are notoriously closed about what they are doing, but these new open banking API platforms do represent the opportunity that exists in the space.</p>
<p>Until I see robust, open developer areas from Chase, HSBC, Citigroup, and other banking giants, I won&rsquo;t declare APIs getting traction in the banking sector, but I think the ice is thawing, and I feel we are moving from just banks talking about APIs, to banks maybe, kinda sorta considering taking action when it comes to APIs.</p>
<p>Hopefully I will get to talk about more of my conversations in the future, until then I will just showcase what The Open Bank Project and Plaid are up to, hopefully through public, competitive, and regulatory pressure, banks will open up more&mdash;I have little faith that they will do it on their own, without a little nudging.</p>
