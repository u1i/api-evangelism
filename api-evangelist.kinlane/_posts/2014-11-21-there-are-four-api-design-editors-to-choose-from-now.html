<p>In the early days, there was just one API design tool to use, <a href="http://apiary.io">Apiary.io</a>. Now at the end of 2014, we have four separate API design tools to choose from. I credit Apiary.io for opening up this new era of API design, expanding the API life cycle, and emphasizing healthy API design practices over just API deployment and management.</p>
<p>In my opinion the expansion of APIs design formats, and API design tooling is extremely important to the space, allowing API providers to have conversation around API design with developers, and key business stakeholders, before development actually begins. However, the benefits of healthy API design, using leading API definition formats, goes well beyond just design, and the rewards can be seen throughout the entire API lifecycle.</p>
<p>There are three API design tools, from each of the providers of the modern API design formats:</p>
<table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="3" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><a href="http://apiary.io/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-design-editor/apiary-editor.png" alt="" width="250" /></a></td>
<td><a href="http://apiary.io/">Apiary.io</a> - Collaborative design, instant API mock, generated documentation, integrated code samples, debugging and automated testing using the API Blueprint API definition format.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="http://api-portal.anypoint.mulesoft.com/raml/api-designer"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-design-editor/mulesoft-api-designer.png" alt="" width="250" /></a></td>
<td><a href="http://api-portal.anypoint.mulesoft.com/raml/api-designer">API Designer | Anypoint API Portal</a> - Enables the ability to design APIs in the RAML API definition format, and mock, preview and save API designs into a notebook, and integrate with other Mulesoft API tooling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="http://editor.swagger.io"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-design-editor/swagger-editor.png" alt="" width="250" /></a></td>
<td><a href="http://editor.swagger.io">Swagger Editor</a> - Allows the designing APIs in the Swagger format in both YAML and JSON, allowing you to import, edit, preview, and export API design docs.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>All three of these API design tools are developed by the creator of the leading API definition formats, <a href="http://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger</a>, and <a href="http://raml.org/">RAML</a>. (aka. Apiary, Wordnik, and Mulesoft). Now, a significant evolution in the API design tooling space has occurred and a cross format API design tool has emerged from the popular Java API framework <a href="http://restlet.com/">Restlet</a>.</p>
<table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="3" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><a href="http://studio.restlet.com"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-design-editor/restlet-studio.png" alt="" width="250" /></a></td>
<td><a href="http://studio.restlet.com">Restlet Studio</a> - Allows you to create, and load API designs in Swagger and RAML formats, save, and generate server side scaffolding, and client side SDKs in multiple languages.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The emergence of the Restlet Studio is significant because it represents the expansion API design tooling beyond the three leading API definition format providers, as well as being the first cross-format API design editor. There are other API service providers who deliver vital API services along the API lifecycle like <a href="http://smartbear.com/product/ready-api/overview/">Ready! API</a>, for mocking and testing your APIs, or <a href="https://apimatic.io/">APIMATIC</a> which generates SDKs, both of which support multiple API definition formats, but Restlet Studio is the first cross-format purely API design editor (correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be spending more time mapping out all of the tools that are emerging to deliver vital services throughout the API design life cycle, something that gives me hope for things standardizing when it comes to designing, deploying, managing, and integrating with APIs. It is an exciting time to be in the API space, as the universe rapidly expands, and more companies emerge to help us make sense of this rapid expansion.</p>
