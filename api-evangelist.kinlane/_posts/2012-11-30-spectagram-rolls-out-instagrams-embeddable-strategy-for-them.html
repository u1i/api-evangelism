<p>There was a great post last week on <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/">ProgrammableWeb</a> from Curtis C. Chen (<a href="https://twitter.com/sparCKL">@sparCKL</a>), on how a company called <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/11/22/spectragram-is-a-gateway-to-instagram-api/">Spectagram has launched a new JavaScript library built on top of </a><a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/instagram">Instagram</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://lab.adrianquevedo.com/jquery-spectragram/">Spectagram</a> uses JQuery to provide a basic set of embeddable tools for Instagram allowing users to embed widgets showing latest photos, popular photos, and photos by tag.</p>
<p>Instagram has been notoriously focused on their core product, which leaves a lot of areas open to its developer community.  Even the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/02/08/instagram-launches-api/">first version of the Instagram</a> API was created by a passionate developer.</p>
<p>It is interesting to see such a sophisticated Javascript library developed by a developer, essentially rolling out something <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/instagram">Instagram</a> should be doing themselves, but obviously haven&rsquo;t prioritized.  Something I&rsquo;m sure many API owners would love to have happen in their communities.</p>
