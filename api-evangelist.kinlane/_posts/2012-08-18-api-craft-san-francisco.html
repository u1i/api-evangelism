<p>On the heels of the successful <a title="API Craft OSCON Portland, OR" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/07/20/definition-of-api-craft/">API Craft meetup in Portland during OSCON</a>, I was landing in San Francisco for a few days and at the request of SFO API folk, quickly organized a meetup at the Chieftain Pub, and thanks to <a title="@abraham" href="https://twitter.com/abraham">@abraham</a> it was a great turnout.</p>
<p>10-15 people showing up seems to be about the normal for these events, and this API craft had a good showing of API Service Providers with 3Scale, Apigee, Mashery and Mashape representing.  Then we had API folks from IFTTT, Pearson and SendGrid.</p>

<p>It was also great to have out fellow evangelist and unicorn herder, @abraham.  The SFO API Craft meetup was another great gathering in a growing trend within the API community, and I plan on having them in every city that I can, I hope you do too!</p>
