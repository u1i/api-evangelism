<p>Here is a video of one of my talks from <a title="API Days" href="http://apidays.io/">API Days in Paris</a>, France where I walked through potential thoughts on business model for a hypothetical startup. &nbsp;I had a separate talk prepared, but after attending the first day I went and found a french cafe, drank a couple bottles of wine, took what I learned and produced this talk.</p>
