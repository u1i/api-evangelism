<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/3D-Printing/3d-printing-software.JPG" alt="" width="250" align="right" />When it comes to creating 3D models for 3D printing there are many types of software to choose from.</p>
<p>3D software solutions range from commercial to free, and can be desktop or part of a newer evolution of web-based applications.</p>
<p>Popular 3D modeling software includeds <a title="3DTin" href="http://www.3dtin.com">3DTin</a>, <a title="Tinkercad" href="http://tinkercad.com" target="_blank">Tinkercad</a> and complete 3D printing solutions like <a title="Shapeways" href="/admin/blog/www.shapeways.com" target="_blank">Shapeways</a>.</p>
<p>One major player that was acquired by Google, is <a title="Sketchup" href="/admin/blog/sketchup.google.com" target="_blank">SketchUp</a>.  SketchUp is building a large following of amateur and professional 3D designers and creators.</p>
<p>Many software solutions like Sketchup and Shapeways are finding success by simplifying the 3D modeling process and making it accessible by anyone.</p>
<p>As many software solutions move online it opens up the possibility for data portability, collaboration and many other aspects that will fuel growth in 3D printing.</p>
<p>3D modeling software is a critical link in the evolving <a title="3D print and manufacturing supply chain" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printing-and-manufacturing-supply-chain/">3D print and manufacturing supply chain</a>.</p>
