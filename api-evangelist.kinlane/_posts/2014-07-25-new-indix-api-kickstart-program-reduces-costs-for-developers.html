<p>I like to showcase examples of companies who use their API communities as incubators, establishing them as a sort of external R&amp;D lab that invests in 3rd party developers who are building cool stuff on top of their API driven resources.</p>
<p>I came across an <a href="http://www.indix.com/blog/announcing-indix-api-v1-0-kickstart-program">announcement from product intelligence platform Indix</a>, in my usual monitoring of the API space, and they have a pretty cool program for their developers:</p>
<blockquote><em>Indix KickStart &ndash; a program to help startups and small businesses accelerate the development of product-aware applications and deliver rich product-aware experiences.</em></blockquote>
<p>Indix is looking to jumpstart early stage startups use of the Indix product API. Companies that have less than $1 million in funding and $100,000 in revenue are eligible apply, and Indix will evaluate the startups potential for receiving access to the Indix API at a reduced price point.</p>
<p>There are numerous ways to incentivize developers usage of an API, and Indix&rsquo;s approach is one possible way to established a trusted developer access tier, where you can raise access limits, reduce costs, and potentially reducing a new startup&rsquo;s overhead, and their chances of success.</p>
