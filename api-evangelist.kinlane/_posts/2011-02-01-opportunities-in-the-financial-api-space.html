According to <a href="http://forrester.com/">Forrester Research</a>, the <a href="http://forrester.com/rb/Research/us_mobile_banking_forecast,_2010_to_2015/q/id/57446/t/2">U.S. mobile banking market has experienced rapid growth in the past three years</a>, more than doubling from 5% of online adults in 2007 to 12% in Q2 2010.

By 2015, Forrester predicts that one in five US adults will be using mobile banking. Forrester attributes this to the adoption of smart phones.<p></p>
I would say we are in the biggest growth period for financial and payment APIs since <a class="zem_slink" title="PayPal" rel="homepage" href="http://paypal.com">PayPal</a> launched its API in 2004.<p></p>
With this kind of growth in mobile banking, you can easily predict the need for high quality, secure, financial and payment related APIs.<p></p>
We will see a lot more growth, innovation and competition in the financial API space in next 4 years.
