<p>I get regular requests to add APIs to my website via email, Twitter, and carrier pigeon. I have an Evernote that I put these requests into, and as I have time, I review, then possibly add to the appropriate API Evangelist network project.</p>
<p>To support this process, I've crafted a new response email to requests I get, that I thought I would share with everyone:</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>Sure thing. It could take me a day or two, or maybe up to a week.</p>
<p>You are also welcome to fork any of the 60+ API Evangelist network projects, and add to the JSON list that is driving the listing, they are all under the /data folder. Otherwise I'll add as I have time in the next week.</p>
<p>Once you submit your pull request, if your company listing is relevant to the research I&rsquo;m doing, I will accept your addition. No guarantees, so make sure it will provide value to not just my research, but to the API community.</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing information about your API!</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>It is a little known fact that all <a href="http://kinlane.com/projects/">60+ plus of my research projects</a> run as Github repositories, using Github and Jekyll to drive the overall website and blog. With this approach, everyone can fork any of my projects, add a company to a listing, post to the blog, or correct a spelling or grammar error.</p>
<p>Just remember, when you are looking to get the word out about your API, or new feature, you can help curate and publish on the API Evangelist network.</p>
