One of the aspects of my current job that I enjoy, is the transparent nature of my role. My job is to generate attention for <a href="http://www.mimeo.com">Mimeo</a> and the Mimeo Connect <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/cloud-computing/cloud-print/">Cloud Print</a> <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">API</a>.<p></p>
Let me give you an example. In various roles I've had at companies as lead developer, director of technology, or just a developer I spend a lot of time researching new technologies.<p></p>
When I research new technologies I usually create some sort of overview document, a presentation and probably some sort of sample code or prototype.

In legacy positions I do all this hard work, and usually submit to my boss and maybe do apresentationto other teams. Often times, my work goes nowhere.<p></p>
In my new role as an API Evangelist I enjoy a lot of transparency. I get to talk about my work as I'm learning. For exmple I wrote these blog posts yesterday:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/01/programming-with-pdfs/" target="_blank"><strong>Programming with PDFs</strong></a> - I am building a list of APIs and <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/open-source/">Open Source</a> PDF tools I want to use, integrate and create resources for my developers.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/01/programming-with-images-using-imagemagick/" target="_blank"><strong>Programming with Images Using ImageMagick</strong></a> - Similar to PDFs I want a full suite of tools and resources for empower developers to program using images.</li>
</ul>
My project work involves me doing a lot of research and testing, and I get to share this information in real-time. If the projects move forward I will blog about improvements as they happen. So my documentation and presentations often go public as I create them.<p></p>
If a project doesn't go anywhere, the information is still out there. It is still on my blog and on my <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/twitter/">Twitter</a> account. This can bring added SEO benefit to all my projects and help me in the future, you never know when it will come back around.<p></p>
In other roles where I don't enjoy the same transparency this information would never see the light of day.
