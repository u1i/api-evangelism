Salesforce is gearing up for the <a href="http://blog.sforce.com/sforce/2010/10/rest-api-programmableweb-and-curl.html">upcoming release of their REST API</a> on October 26, with a <a href="https://www.developerforce.com/events/rest_developer_preview/registration.php?d=70130000000FV4U">REST API Developer Preview Webinar</a>.

The release of the a RESTful API for the <a href="http://developer.force.com/">developerforce platform</a> is a major sign of upcoming growth for the cloud computing platform.<p></p>
REST APIs enjoy lmuch larger acceptance in the developer community compared to SOAP APIs.  SOAP is a favorite amongst the enterprise and hard-core development communities, but REST is easier to understand and have lower barriers of entry for more web 2.0 oriented programmers.<p></p>
As cloud computing is gaining acceptance with the masses, and the smoke is clearing around how to actually make the cloud work,  SalesForce is making a major move to woo more businesses and developers to their platform.<p></p>
I think this is just a first of many moves by the proven cloud platform to not only defend their position as the leader in Platform as a Service, but grow significantly in the next couple of years.
