<p>When you hear about the Internet of Things (IoT) you often hear about the hopeful consumer side of thing, like with Nest thermostat, and the next wave of Internet-connected devices that will change our personal worlds forever. Personally, when I think about the concept of Internet-connected devices actually seeing adoption, and getting traction, I think of it being applied in an industrial setting.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://info.opto22.com/snap-pac-rest-api-thank-you">The RESTful&nbsp;programmable automation controllers (PACs) APIs out of Opto 22 resemble this vision of IoT which I have in my head</a>. APIs making everyday objects used in a variety of industrial processes, programmable, and accessible over wired or wireless networks. Making everything from manufacturing&nbsp;to water and energy facilities more automated and efficient, while potentially generated data that can be used to monitor, and optimize these industrial workflows--this is IoT.</p>
<p>The dream of home automation just doesn't do it for me. I just don't buy the Jetsons vision of the home, but I can buy into the potential for IoT making the industrial processes which we depend on to make our world operate more efficient. Consumer IoT seems like a bandwagon to me, but proven industrial equipment manufacturers like <a href="http://info.opto22.com/snap-pac-rest-api-thank-you">Opto 22 realizing the potential of web API infrastructure</a>, and baking it into the devices they manufacture, seems like real world IoT business to me.</p>
