<p>I was having one of my regular Google Hangouts with the OG API Evangelist John Musser (<a href="https://twitter.com/johnmusser">@johnmusser</a>) the other day as I was flying back from east coast, and he made a comment about my classic API Evangelist drawing, and said I should write the ten commandments of APIs.</p>
<p>At first I thought, not my style, but on second thought, what the hell. Here they are:</p>
<ol class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Deliver Value </strong>- Generate value for consumers, without value APIs mean nothing.</li>
<li><strong>Provide Documentation</strong> - Provide clean, simple, up to date API documentation for users.</li>
<li><strong>Code Libraries</strong> - Deliver code sample, libraries, SDKs, or starter projects in a variety of languages.</li>
<li><strong>Provide Support</strong> - If you don&rsquo;t support your APIs, your efforts won&rsquo;t be sustainable.</li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Don&rsquo;t Break</span> Minimize Breaking Shit </strong>- You will never establish trust with consumers if you break your shit all the time.</li>
<li><strong>Business Model </strong>- Without a business model for your API, they will not be sustainable.</li>
<li><strong>Terms of Service</strong> - Establish TOS that protect your company's interests, but allow consumers to prosper and grow.</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong> - Establish solid security practices that keep your resources secure, while also protecting all users involved.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy</strong> - Passionately protect the privacy of your API consumers and end-users.</li>
<li><strong>Tell Stories </strong>- Craft and tell meaningful stories about the value your APIs deliver or nobody will will know or care about them.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are my 10 commandments for API providers, and represent what I think are the 10 most important elements of delivering APIs. If you follow these 10 commandments, in your API design, development, deployment, and management you will find happiness. ;-)</p>
<p>These commandments won&rsquo;t guarantee your success in the market, but they will guarantee that you will learn and grow in your API initiative, whether its internal or external&mdash;which in my opinion is the most important aspect of adopting an API way of life.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Adjusting breaking shit, as John cites below. It is inevitable so minimizing is my advice.</p>
