<p>If you've met me in person, you know I always wear my logo on my t-shirt. &nbsp;I'm not a graphic designer, and when I needed a logo for <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, I just wrapped the words in JSON and called it good. &nbsp;It has stuck. &nbsp;</p>
<p>When I was in France speaking at <a href="http://apidays.io">API Days</a>, the art director at <a href="http://www.fabernovel.com/en/">faberNovel</a>&nbsp;drew some <a href="/2012/12/10/api-evangelist-drawings/">very cool sketches of me</a>. &nbsp;He recently followed up with some more high resolution images I can use for t-shirts. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Very cool! Thank you so much Benoit Talabot and <a href="http://www.fabernovel.com/en/">faberNovel</a>! &nbsp;I'm working on ordering some t-shirts using the work, right now on Inkd.</p>
