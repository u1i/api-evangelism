<p><a title="University of Washington" href="http://webservices.washington.edu/"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/universities/UW-Web-Service-Registry.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I recently stumbled across the <a title="University of Washingtons Web Services Area" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2012/05/29/university-information-access-with-apis/">University of Washington&rsquo;s Web Services area</a>, where they are working to create a single place to learn about, discover and connect with various APIs that are available at the University.</p>
<p>As the home page says:</p>
<blockquote><em>Web Services at the University of Washington is a method of getting important institutional data from and/or into your applications. Web Services are a way for applications or systems to talk to one another and does not usually involve human interaction.</em></blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m always trying to understand where the next wave of API growth might come from, and while the enterprise is definintely sitting on a treasure chest of information and resources, just waiting to be exposed via APIs--I think Universities might be in the same position.</p>
<p>As soon as Universities start realizing how many APIs they have laying around already, and understand the potential of launching new ones, they are going to have a massive API management problem.</p>
<p>I stumbled across UW APIs via a <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://www.programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a> update of 7 web services from the University.  I started looking around further, and discovered there were 29 total APIs available at UW Web Services.  I&rsquo;m not sure why only 7 are listed at PW, but right there you start seeing slippage in the current API directory model.</p>
<p>Quickly invdividual schools are going to face the same <a title="problems Google has faced with its almost 100 APIs" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/12/21/business-of-google-apis-2011/">problems Google has faced with its almost 100 APIs</a> and need to standardize their management platform with:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Access</strong> - Usage of a healthy balance of keys and OAuth for accessing school and student data&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Discovery</strong> - Establish some sort of WADL or other discovery service that can feed not just a human directory but IDEs and other programmatic discovery.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Explorer</strong> - Provide an API explorer so developers and even non-programmers can make calls against any API without writing code&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Billing</strong> - Establish some sort of billing layer, if only for making high volume users pay for access and pay for infrastructure--but also possibly opening up new revenue streams for universities</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to these areas, Universities will have to establish a common set of API building blocks that they will use across all departments, creating a consistent API area for developers to use while learning about and integrating with University Web Services.</p>
<p>With some proper planning and a little work, each University could setup a highly functional API strateg and management framework allowing them to efficiently manage not just dozens of APIs, but thousands across all areas of the University.</p>
<p>Think of the opportunities for students to build out much needed mobile and web applications around school information as part of class projects.  The benefits of having self-service interfaces that individual departments can use to get the information they need, as well as for 3rd party vendors who need access to vital school data.</p>
<p>Next, would be to create a state and federal discovery layer on top of each University, allowing better oversight and interaction between government and Universities--but that will have to come later, we have a lot of work to do at each University before we get there.</p>
