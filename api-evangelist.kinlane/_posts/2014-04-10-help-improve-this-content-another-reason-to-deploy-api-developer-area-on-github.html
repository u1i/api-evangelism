<p>I just published a post <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/10/developer-portals-on-github-example-from-socrata/">showcasing Socrata's use of Github to deploy their new open data and API developer portal.</a> There are <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/06/08/api-management-using-github/">numerous reasons for using Github as part of your API management strategy</a>, with one of the main reasons being the collaborative features that Git, and the social coding platform Github introduce.</p>
<p>I've had the news about Socrata&rsquo;s new developer portal open for over a day now, and what triggered that story was seeing a link to the <a href="http://api.data.gov/docs/regulations/#!/regulations.json/">regulations API on data.gov</a>, which not only just uses Swagger for the API definition, it employs a simple portal that is deployed using Github pages.</p>
<p>Deploying API developer areas on Github, using Github pages is nothing new, we've been doing it a while now. However there is a groundswell within federal government recently, so I think its worth noting&mdash;hoping other open data and API folks in government jump in too!</p>
<p>I like the basic layout of the regulations API portal. It is a simple overview, changelog, terms of service and interactive API documentation using Swagger. Then demonstrating one of the biggest benefits of deploying your developer portal on Github, it simply says: <strong><em>&ldquo;Help Improve This Content&rdquo;</em></strong>, directing users to edit, fork and submit a pull requests on the portal&rsquo;s Github repository&mdash;enabling anyone to improve the portal content, with the approval of the API administrator of course.</p>
