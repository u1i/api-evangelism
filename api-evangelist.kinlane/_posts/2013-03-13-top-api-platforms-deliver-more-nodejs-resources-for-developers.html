<p><a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node.js</a>, the server-side software system designed for writing scalable Internet applications in JavaScript, seems to be getting more attention lately from top API providers because of its event-driven, asynchronous I/O that can minimizeoverhead and maximize scalability.</p>
<p>Last week <a href="https://github.com/google/google-api-nodejs-client/#readme">Google released an official Node.js client library for accessing Google APIs </a>that supports authorization and authentication using OAuth 2.0.  Then earlier this week, Amazon Web Services announced that <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2013/03/aws-elastic-beanstalk-for-nodejs.html">AWS Elastic Beanstalk, their PaaS solution now supports Node.js applications</a>.</p>
<p>While Google&rsquo;s deployment is a client, and AWS&rsquo;s is an application platform, they both have the same objective--enabling developers to build highly reliable, scalable, and cost-effective applications using APIs.</p>
<p>Both Google and AWS recognize the potential for selling developers their valuable API driven resources, by providing them with Node.js solutions.  <a href="https://github.com/languages/JavaScript">JavaScript is the number one language on Github</a>, with Node dominating most starred and most forked overall categories, according to Github trends.</p>
<p>I think that AWS and Github both send a good signal to other API owners, that they need to step up the availablity of Node.js resources for their API developer communities.</p>
