<p>I was working in&nbsp;<a href="http://restlet.com/technical-resources/apispark/guide">APISpark</a>, playing around with different approaches to creating APIs for data stores i have in Amazon S3, Github, and in Google Spreadsheets. The cloud API deployment solution allows me to generate APIs from CSV, XML, JSON and spreadsheet stores in these locations, to a central API platform faster than I could even consider doing manually.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m managing a simple data API I have, I see the option to generate a &ldquo;server skeleton&rdquo; in the toolbar, something that is also available to me when working in the <a href="http://restlet.com/products/restlet-studio/">Restlet Studio</a>. This is one of the benefits of creating machine readable API definitions like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> or <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API blueprint</a> of your APIs. Restlet doesn&rsquo;t generate server code for you from your file stores, it generates a machine readable definition of your file source, then lets you generate a &ldquo;server skeleton&rdquo; from that.</p>
<p>Server skeletons are not a fully functioning API for your file store, APISpark gives you that. These server skeletons are just scaffolding in Java or Node.js, that give you a starting framework for deploying an API beyond the Restlet / APISpark platform. You still have to wire things up to the file store, database, or other location of the data store&mdash;it is just the beginning.</p>
<p>I guess my goals with this post is to educate people that it is possible to generate server skeletons from APISpark, using common data sources, but I also just like the name. I have used the term server-side scaffolding, but I like server skeletons better. I think I will keep using it to describe what you can generate server side when you employ API definition formats like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> or <a href="/admin/blog/API blueprint">API Blueprint</a>.</p>
