Recently they made a huge effort in turning this around, with a campaign called <a title="Operation Developer Love" href="http://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/495">Operation Developer Love</a>.<p></p>
Each week they recap whats happened within the development community and provide some other nuggets of information:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Code Samples</li>
	<li>Forum Activity</li>
	<li>Bugzilla Activity</li>
</ul>
This week they also provided an overview of how they are improving their documentation.<p></p>
They also provide some insight into some developer site latency, and how they've move the site to some new servers and show a graph of significantly improved performance.

Operation Developer Love is a great example of actively trying to engage your API developer community.<p></p>
I'm impressed by Facebooks efforts to open up and engage.
