<p><a href="http://www.emergentone.com/" target="_blank">Emergent One</a>, one of the newest <a href="/2012/06/15/api-service-provider-roundup-for-2012/" target="_blank">API management players</a> on the block, just announced a new free development tier.</p>
<p>The Emergent One platform provides simple, cloud-based tools for connecting to your MySQL or PostgreSQL database, and quickly generating an API from your database.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t sign up for their service when they first launched, because they didn&rsquo;t have a free tier, and I&rsquo;m unwilling to put in credit cards and commit to brand new services. This is something I have problem with from running development and IT teams who use a wide variety of cloud services.  I would spend a great deal of time each month chasing down charges and other issues from cloud services that were being experimented with.</p>
<p>The Emergent One approach to deploying APIs from common data sources, is one I think will resonate with users who aren&rsquo;t developers, but understand the importance of APIs, and are often restrained by unresponsive, limited or no IT resources.</p>

<p>Emergent One one is responding to user requests for a cheaper tier that support entry level API users, which will allow them to tweak their API strategies before spending money.  This is something I think is mandatory for all API service providers, something <a href="http://3scale.net/">3Scale</a> were the first movers on, and we have seen <a href="http://apigee.com/about/pricing">Apigee</a> implement recently, as well as&nbsp;<a href="/serviceproviders/layer_7_technologies.php" target="_blank">Layer7</a> with their <a href="http://www.apify.co/" target="_blank">Apify</a>.</p>
<p>I notice that in the email announcement of the 100% free tier, it encourages me to build new APIs at no cost, <strong><em>&ldquo;until launch&rdquo;</em></strong>.  I hope Emergent One will agree that a entry level pricing tier is not critical for users to get to know Emergent One, but essential for educating the masses about the value of APIs--allowing them to experiment. So le'ts please make sure it isn&rsquo;t only until launch.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m setting up some APIs, directly from one of my Amazon RDS instances. &nbsp; I'll let you know when ready.</p>
