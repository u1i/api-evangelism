<p>I was spending time thinking about API discovery methodologies this afternoon (I know...I have issues), but with <a title="ProgrammableWeb approaching 8K public APIs" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/">ProgrammableWeb approaching 8K public APIs</a>, its a very real problem.</p>
<p>Currently, as an application developer, when I have an idea, I start by sketching what I want to build and set out to find all of the resources I will need to make it a reality.  I pick my platform of choice and then set out to find other API resources I will need to bring my app to life.</p>
<p>I will need a database, user management and some analytics for my back-end, selecting a <a title="Backend as a Service" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/08/22/mobile-backend-as-a-service-roundup-and-the-future-of-web-apis/">Backend as a Service</a>&nbsp;(BaaS)&nbsp;provider like <a title="CloudMine" href="https://cloudmine.me/">CloudMine</a> or <a title="Kinvey" href="http://www.kinvey.com/">Kinvey</a>.  Next I need authentication and social integration with <a title="Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn using Singly" href="http://www.singly.com">Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn using Singly</a>.  After this I will have to piece together my application from a variety of individual APIs like <a title="Twilio" href="http://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>, <a title="Urban Airship" href="http://urbanairship.com/">Urban Airship</a>, <a title="Iron.io" href="http://Iron.io">Iron.io</a> and many other APIs.</p>
<p>What if we flipped this on its head and reversed the process?  As an application developer, I could publish a list of resources I need for my web or mobile app, and APIs could find me.  I could just publish my need for image storage, facial recognition, location and other resources and API providers could find me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a brain exercise to see if I&rsquo;m missing anything.  Maybe the problem we need to solve isn&rsquo;t API discovery, it&rsquo;s application discovery? &nbsp;Enable APIs to find developers, in addition to developers finding APIs.</p>
