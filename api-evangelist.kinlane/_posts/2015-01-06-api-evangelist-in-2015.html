<p>In 2015, I will enter the 5th year of API Evangelist. To quote one of my favorite bands--&ldquo;What a Long Strange Trip Its Been&rdquo;.  I couldn&rsquo;t be more thankful for the career choice I made in 2010, and extremely grateful for the partners, and loyal readers I&rsquo;ve established along the way.</p>
<p>This list is very long, but I have to <a href="http://3scale.net">specifically call out 3Scale</a>, and their support of what I do, without them API Evangelist wouldn&rsquo;t be happening, I wouldn&rsquo;t be doing my research, and open projects like <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, and <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a> wouldn&rsquo;t exist&mdash;additionally we wouldn&rsquo;t be having the <a href="https://twitter.com/apistrat">@APIStrat</a> conversation that 3Scale makes happen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a big year end wrap-up or predictor type of guy, but this doesn&rsquo;t mean I do not spend a lot of time reflecting this time of year. I honestly don&rsquo;t feel like anything has changed for me, I&rsquo;m just as dedicated to my API Evangelist in 2015 as I ever have, and here is what I&rsquo;m focusing on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Storytelling</strong> - Telling stories on my blogs about what the smartest people in the space are doing with APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Research</strong> - Researching how APIs are impacting a variety of industries, government, and even our personal world.</li>
<li><strong>Universities</strong> - I am convinced that the next generation workforce needs to be digitally literate to be successful. </li>
<li><strong>APIStrat &amp; API Days</strong> - Helping facilitate the important tech, business, and political conversations that happen at <a href="http://apistrat.com/">APIStrat</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.apidays.io/">API Days</a>.</li>
<li><strong>APIs.json</strong> - Encourage the use of APIs.json to assist in API discovery, and enable the assembling of the next generation API stacks.</li>
</ul>
<p>While there is a lot more going on, this is my primary focus, and what you will find me doing most of the time in 2015. I will be seriously cutting back my travel, to focus on my research and storytelling. You can find me at APIStrat and API Days events, and at <a href="http://www.defragcon.com/">Defrag</a> and <a href="http://www.gluecon.com/">Gluecon</a>, but beyond that I feel the biggest impact I make is keeping up with the space, telling stories, and publishing research that folks can use.</p>
<p>When it comes to predictions, I&rsquo;m in alignment with 3Scale (once again). I think <a href="http://www.3scale.net/2015/01/api-predictions-2015/">their list of 2015 API predictions</a> is very pragmatic, and provides a healthy view of what 2015 will look, where the most important thing that happens this year, is the steady, healthy growth of the API sector.</p>
