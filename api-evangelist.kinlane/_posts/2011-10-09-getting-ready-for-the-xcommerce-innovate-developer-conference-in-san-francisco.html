<p>
     I'm getting ready for the <a href="http://www.innovate-conference.com/">X.Commerce Innovate Developer Conference 2011</a>, at Moscone Center in San Francisco this week.
</p>
<p>
     <a href="https://www.x.com/">X.Commerce</a> is the merging of <a href="https://www.x.com/developers/paypal">Paypal</a>, <a href="https://www.x.com/developers/ebay">eBay</a> and <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/">Magento's</a> developer ecosystems into a single developer community empowering the next generation of merchants who need to operate in the world of global, multi-channel commerce.
</p>
<p>
     The APIs that make up X.Commerce are:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a href="https://www.x.com/developers/paypal"><strong>Paypal</strong></a> - Website Payment Pro, Express Checkout and Adaptive Payments are a a couple of Paypals Payment APIs that X.Commerce developers can take advantage of.
     </li>
     <li>
          <a href="https://www.x.com/developers/ebay"><strong>eBay</strong></a> - The hardened suite of search, trading and buying APIs from the popular auction platform that was one of the <a title="early pioneers of the web API space" href="/2011/01/26/history-of-apis-ebay/">early pioneers in the web API space</a>.
     </li>
     <li>
          <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/"><strong>Magento</strong></a> - The API allows access to the Customer, Catalog and Order modules of any users Magento E-Commerce account.
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     X.Commerce strives to bring together Marketplace, Payment, Mobile Products into a single developer ecosystem, with essential Account Management, Information and Reporting Products.
</p>
<p>
     Even though you still have to go out to each individual sites developer ecosystems, you can tell they are working to bring together the communities in a central next generation merchant portal.
