One of the keys to YouTube's success as a video sharing platform is its successful API that allows developers and site owners to embed, share and distribute YouTube content across the Intertubes.

As with many of its other products, Google starts with the essential API ecosystem building blocks:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Dashboard</li>
	<li>Quickstart</li>
	<li>Docs</li>
	<li>Sample Code</li>
	<li>Forum</li>
	<li>Articles</li>
	<li>Blog</li>
</ul>
In addition, YouTube really support its partner and developers with:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Partners Showcase</li>
	<li>App Gallery</li>
	<li>Widgets</li>
	<li>White Label Player</li>
</ul>
Google also enforces brand integrity with a few tools:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Branding Guidelines</li>
	<li>Compatibility</li>
	<li>Terms</li>
</ul>
Google definitely has a solid formula for replicating its API ecosystems in its different products, and the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/overview.html">YouTube developer area</a> is an excellent example of this formula being applied to a media API.<p></p>
Like Google's other projects, YouTube utilizes <a href="http://code.google.com">Google Code</a> as the repository for its API community and code.
