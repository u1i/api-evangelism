<p>I spend a lot of time looking for good quality logos to represent the companies I track on and write stories about. I have a certain vision in my head about how I want company listings and detail pages to look across the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/network.html">API Evangelist network</a>&mdash;something that takes a lot of work.</p>
<p>To support this vision, I spend a lot of time looking for logos. Sometimes you can find them in the header of a website, but often times they are poor quality, not configured to be standalone, or difficult to get at for any number of other reasons--making my work a lot tougher.</p>
<p>I published a new list of 819 companies who are doing interesting things with APIs that I call&nbsp;<a href="http://theapistack.com/">The API Stack</a>. After publishing the project, <a href="https://www.concur.com">Concur</a>, one of the <a href="http://theapistack.com/stack.html?tag=travel-stack">travel API providers</a>&nbsp;listed, tweeted at me asking if I could replace their logo with a better quality one from their <a href="https://www.concur.com/en-us/logos">official logo page</a>--I did so very quickly!</p>
<p>I sure love me a good logo and branding page for an API. It makes my life easier, by giving me a single place to go get high quality logos, without having to open up my image editor. I wish that more API platforms would have a well designed logo page like <a href="https://www.concur.com">Concur</a>.</p>
