<p>API ecosystems are all about research &amp; development, and an opportunity for incubating ideas and apps in a way that invites 3rd party developers and companies to develop innovative ways of using your company assets and resources.  I&rsquo;ve discussed <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/01/31/four-potential-levels-of-an-api-business-ecosystem/">incubation within an API ecosystem before,</a>&nbsp;and how companies are not just identifying developer talent and the best apps, but actually investing in companies via their API.</p>
<p>A new example of this in action is Nike's&nbsp;launch of their&nbsp;<a href="http://nikeaccelerator.com/index.html" target="_blank">Nike+ Accelerator</a>--a partnership with <a title="Techstars" href="http://www.techstars.com/">TechStars</a> that will host 10 companies for a three-month, immersive, mentor-driven startup accelerator designed to spur development on the&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.nike.com/">NikeFuel, the Nike+ FuelBand, and Nike+ Running API platform</a>.</p>
<p>The 10 partner companies will be given the following:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>$20,000</li>
<li>Access to the Nike+ APIs, Nike+ mobile SDKs, and Nike+ FuelBand Dev Kit (Beta) - you will be among the first in the world to receive this access</li>
<li>A Nike+ FuelBand for each team member</li>
<li>Tech support from experienced developers who've built companies, or built with Nike+ Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)</li>
<li>Code and solution reviews during the program</li>
<li>Mentor sessions with Nike executives and leaders in the start-up community</li>
<li>Two Investor Demo Days: one at the Nike World Headquarters and one in Silicon Valley</li>
<li>Real Access to Decision Makers</li>
</ul>

<p>Then, at the end of the Nike+ Accelerator, each team will present to Nike executives, mentors, angel investors, venture capitalists, and tech industry leaders.</p>
<p>As an API publisher have you considered a built-in accelerator or incubation program within your API ecosystem?  And while I&rsquo;m at it, has your incubator or accelerator consider a partnership program tailored for API publishers?</p>
<p>Sounds kind of like a Reese's Peanut Butter commercial! :)</p>
