<p>Code samples in a variety of languages are how API owners help developers understand an API in the language that makes the most sense to them.</p>
<p>Not all developers will understand REST, HTTP and other things you might take for granted.  Very simple code samples will help demonstrate an APIs functionality, making the learning process a hands-on experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> provides a very lightweight tool for publishing API code samples, that can be embedded on any website, called <a title="Gist" href="https://gist.github.com/">Gists</a>.  You can easily copy / paste a working code sample into a Gist and Github returns a lightweight, embeddable JavaScript that you can use in documentation, blog posts and any where you will need to share with users.</p>
<p>Github Gists can be a much sexier, and easier to implement alternative to html &lt;code&gt; tags. While also allowing easy management and versioning of API code samples alongside <a title="Github API SDK Management" href="/2012/10/25/sdk-management-for-your-api-with-github/">Github API SDK repositories</a>.</p>
