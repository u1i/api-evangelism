<a href="http://www.meetup.com" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/meetup.png" alt="" align="right" /></a>Events are definitely one of the most important tools in an <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com" target="_blank">API Evangelist's</a> tool box.<p></p>
Making a regular showing at popular events both on and offline is critical to building the awareness and the trust of the development community.<p></p>
Speaking at major events is the best route to reach developers if you're targeting larger conferences, as exhibiting is not as rewarding as it once was.<p></p>
However, <a href="http://www.meetup.com" target="_blank">meetups</a> and hackathons are the future.<p></p>
Reaching the developer audience requires being able to step up to the bar with a pint of beer and being able to go the distance at hackathons.

Traditional marketing techniques are often tuned out by the new development crowd and having a presence, building trust and mingling with the community are key.<p></p>
Stay in tune with your local meetup and hackathon calendars.  And make your own schedule known.  Broadcast events you will be attending and make sure an <a href="http://blog.twilio.com/2011/02/twilio-on-the-road-in-january-pennapps-and-philly-startup-weekend.html" target="_blank">provide quality recaps of where you've been</a>.<p></p>
A healthy part of any evangelism is a good roadshow, so make sure to produce yours in a way that truly connects with your audience.
