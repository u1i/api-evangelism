<p><a href="http://googleadsdeveloper.blogspot.com/2013/01/new-simplified-adwords-api-pricing.html" target="_blank">Google is adjusting their pricing model for the Adwords API</a>, acknowledging that having a free usage tier is important. &nbsp;Making the API easier to access, while also ensuring a certain QOS.</p>
<p>Google has opted to go with two levels of API access:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Basic</strong> - Basic access is provided by default and allows up to 10,000 operations per day</li>
<li><strong>Standard</strong> - Standard access is available to qualified developers and has no daily limit on operations</li>
</ul>
<p>With both basic or standard access, there are no charges for <a href="https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/" target="_blank">AdWords API</a> usage.  Google is just looking to maintain quality over which developers can hammer on the API, while acknowledging a free tier allows for experimentation and innovation. &nbsp;All you have to do is apply to be part of the standard level, if you reach limits of basic tier.</p>
<p>This is a good model for even a totally open data of free resource APIs.  While you want your data and resources to be open, you also want to be able to offer a certain quality of service, and keep infrastructure costs to a minimum.</p>
<p>To do this, you will need to to secure the API interface to some degree.</p>
