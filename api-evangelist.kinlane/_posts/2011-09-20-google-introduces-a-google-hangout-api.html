<p>Not even a week after Google rolled out the long awaited <a title="Google+ API" href="/2011/09/16/google-api-a-technology-review/">Google+ API</a>, they <a title="rolled out Google+ Hangouts API" href="http://googleplusplatform.blogspot.com/2011/09/introducing-google-hangouts-api.html">launched the Google+ Hangouts API</a>, enabling developers to build collaborative apps that run inside of a Google+ Hangout</p>
<p>The <a title="Google+ Hangout API" href="http://developers.google.com/+/hangouts/">Google+ Hangout API</a> will provide developers with the ability to manipulate the UI, interact with hangout participants and respond to the different events that occur within a hangout. &nbsp;The functionality is reminiscent of the way Google Wave gadgets and robots could interact with a wave and its participants. &nbsp;I wonder if we are seeing some of the Google Wave code being recycled?</p>
<p>To use Google+ you have to register your application with Google, and specify any other Google+ users on your team that will be able to load the application into their hangout. &nbsp;Since the Google+ Hangouts API is only in developer preview, this is temporary requirement.</p>

<p>Once registered, apps behaves like a normal web app, but it also can take part in the real-time conversations within a hangout using the API. &nbsp;Google+ Hangout apps will use whats called a &ldquo;shared state&rdquo; among all instances, notifying users of changes by other application users in real-time.</p>
<p>The decision to release the Google+ clearly was a strategic move against Facebook, which I understand, but I still feel strongly that a empowering developers with a fully write enabled API from the beginning, is very important to setting the tone for the Google+ API ecosystem.</p>
<p>Many developers, including myself <a title="were not happy with the limited functionality of the Google+ API release" href="/2011/09/16/google-api-a-technology-review/">were not happy with the limited functionality of the initial Google+ API release</a>. &nbsp;However, I could tell that Google was being cautious in their API roll-out, and there is potentially much more behind the scenes. &nbsp;I expect Google will be rolling out new APIs as they feel confident, or maybe when they feel it will give them a strategic advantage, like this week during the <a title="Facebook F8 Conference" href="http://www.facebook.com/f8">Facebook F8 conference</a>.</p>
