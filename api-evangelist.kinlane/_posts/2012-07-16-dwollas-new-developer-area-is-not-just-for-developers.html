<p>Next generation payment platform <a title="Dwolla" href="/admin/blog/dwolla.com">Dwolla</a> just revamped the home page of their developer center to speak to the widest audience possible.  When you land at <a title="developers.dwolla.com" href="http://developers.dwolla.com">developers.dwolla.com</a> you are given two options:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="I can code" href="http://developers.dwolla.com/dev">I can code</a></strong> - You know the difference between Java and JavaScript and just want to dive into our API documentation</li>
<li><strong><a title="I don't code" href="http://developers.dwolla.com/bd/why">I don't code</a></strong> - You're a non-technical executive, the master of partnerships and products, and want to know why Dwolla is right for you</li>
</ul>
<p>This is an approach I've been long advocating for, and rarely see in API areas. The best case study I always point out is the <a title="LinkedIn developers area" href="https://developer.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn developers area</a>, who provide buttons, widgets and embeddable tools that non-developers can put to use.</p>
<ul>
</ul>

<p>Why do this? Well according to Dwolla, "One of the biggest misunderstandings about API portals is that their purpose is only for developers. That&rsquo;s just not true. Integrations start with a spark of curiosity, &ldquo;Would this work for my company?&rdquo; Technical or not, who asks that question is irrelevant at that point; how it&rsquo;s answered is what determines the outcome."</p>
<p>Dwolla's approach reflects the core philosophy of why I started API Evangelist.  I'm not advocating just to developers about the power of APIs, I'm evangelizing to the business leaders and decision makers about the power of APIs.</p>
<p>While actually integrating with your API might be a technical endeavor, much of the business decision around using your API will most likely be made by a non-developer.  Make sure your API speaks more than just geek, and reaches as wide an audience as possible.</p>
