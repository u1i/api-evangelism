<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/facebook/facebook-operation-developer-love.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" />In order to be compliant with the <a title="oAuth Spec" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-20">OAuth spec</a>, <a title="Facebook is making changes to their auth APIs" href="http://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/533/">Facebook is making changes to their auth APIs</a>. As part of this update, they will be deprecating 'code_and_token' and need developers to use 'code%20token'. Everything else is identical, just replace '_and_' with encoded'%20'.<p></p>
For example, this call:<p></p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/1128950.js?file=oath-fb.url"></script>It will need to change to:<script type="text/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/1128960.js?file=oath-fb-change.url"></script><p></p>
Developers are required to make this change by November 5th, 2011, and Facebook has <a title="updated their roadmap" href="http://developers.facebook.com/roadmap/">updated their roadmap</a> to reflect this.<p></p>
The communication coming from Facebook Operation Developer Love, and their willingness to <a title="open up their roadmap" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/08/01/how-open-should-we-be-with-our-api-road-maps/">open up their API roadmap</a> is something other API owners should consider in their own ecosystem.
