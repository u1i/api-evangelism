<p>I am continuing to work through notes from a recent push forward of my <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">API monetization</a>, and <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">API plan</a> research. Something that yielded a number of valuable nuggets &nbsp;that I think API providers should be considering when crafting their own strategy. <a href="https://auth0.com/pricing">One of the pricing pages I was looking at as part of my research, was from authentication provider Auth0, which provided a nice way for allowing their customers to toggle between monthly or annual pricing</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://auth0.com/pricing"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/auth0-pricing-switch.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">I organize small elements like this, into my lists of common API building blocks, which help API providers, and API service providers, with a list of things they can consider applying in their own strategies</a>. I like the approach from Auth0 especially, because the toggle actually changes the plan pricing on the page, reflecting the shorter, or longer term costs associated with their authentication services.</p>
<p>Whether your intent is to offer price breaks for longer term relationships, or helping your customers better understand and manage their costs, a simple thing like a time-frame toggle, that adjusts pricing, could make a positive impact. Anyhoo, I just wanted to share this nugget with you, as I was adding it as a <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">building block to my API plan research</a>.</p>
