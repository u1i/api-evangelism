<p>I thought <a href="http://www.nanoscale.io/">the microservices platform Nanoscale.io</a> have an interesting argument for why you would upgrade to a paid plan. <a href="http://www.nanoscale.io/pricing/">On their pricing page</a>, after they break down each of the pricing plans they provide you with four reasons of why you would want to upgrade from their free tier.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>More powerful APIs -</strong> Your nanoscale.io hosted microservices can run longer and perform more complex operations, or access slower source systems, without timing out.</li>
<li><strong>Get premium support - </strong>Having a problem with nanoscale.io? Think you may have found a bug? Submit your inquiry and get a guaranteed response from our technical team.</li>
<li><strong>Influence product roadmap -</strong> We are open to new feature consideration, and give preference to paid accounts to influence which ones get built sooner.</li>
<li><strong>Deploy anywhere -</strong> Upgrade your downloadable nanoscale.io server with a production license to deploy your microservices on any infrastructure you choose.</li>
</ul>
<p>More power and support seems like no-brainers. Being able to influence the roadmap is a compelling reason and something I would pay money for! ;-) The deploy anywhere I think is a sign of the future, not just for how you will buy services for your API, this is how you will deploy your APIs for your consumers. In cloud. On-premise. On-device. You can consume our API anywhere you want--if you pay for it!</p>
<p><a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">I have been aggregating the plans and pricing of API providers, and service providers for a while now</a>. People are getting better at providing a decent breakdown of their API plans, but they aren't always that good at articulating the reasons why you would go from free to a paid plan. I think this is an area of stress, and concern for many API providers, and an area they could use more examples to follow from out in the wild.</p>
