Change happens.  With technology, change seems to be accelerating, or at least the waves of change seem to come more frequently.<p></p>
I feel I've developed a certain rhythm for riding these waves.   Part of this rhythm is a regular evaluation of where I stand, a sort of agile career methodology.  I'm in one of those evaluation periods right now.

What wave is next?<p></p>
In January 2007 I found myself jumping on the social media wave, in which I still ride to some degree.<p></p>
In Spring of 2008 I found myself jumping on the cloud computing wave, in which I'm still totally drowning in.<p></p>
What wave is next?  Mobile?  Big Data?  Semantics?<p></p>
There are many things I consider when evaluating what I will focus my attention on.  I want to make sure I will be investing in learning that will benefit my professional development.<p></p>
One thing I look for are constants within all the waves I ride.  One constant I've seen between Social media and Cloud Computing are APIs.  If you take a deeper look:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Social Media</strong> - YouTube API and Flickr API are at the heart of the social media movement.</li>
	<li><strong>Social Networking </strong>- Facebook API Platform and the Twitter API play a big part in the growth and adoption of social networking.</li>
	<li><strong>Cloud Computing</strong> - The two undisputed kings of cloud computing,  Amazon Web Services and Google both depend on API to deliver their services</li>
</ul>
APIs are playing a monumental role in delivering the Internet today.  What is next?
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Mobile</strong> - APIs make mobile applications possible and help drive innovation in the mobile space.</li>
	<li><strong>Big Data</strong> - APIs allow data to be gathered, shared, and available for visualizations and mashups.</li>
	<li><strong>Semantics</strong> - APIs will drive discovery and meaning around links, documents, and other objects.</li>
</ul>
Pick most any area of business today and you can see APIs either driving or emerging as a major player within that industry.<p></p>
Change is upon me again, whatever the next wave is, I feel I'm secure in focusing on APIs.<p></p>
I am leaving a position as a Director of Technology with a focus on cloud computing to a position as an API Evangelist and with a focus on the business of APIs.<p></p>
This is where I feel future of cloud computing is, as well as many other sectors of our society, throughout business, education, government and much more.<p></p>
Change is exciting.  More to come.
