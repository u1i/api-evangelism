<p>I am evolving <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/17/more-pondering-on-my-own-microservice-definition/">my own personal microservices definition</a>, something that is constantly changing, as I work on my infrastructure, read other people&rsquo;s own definitions (no shortage these lately), and continuing having conversations with smart folks across the space. I had the pleasure of having Mike Amundsen over the other night for dinner, and after having some interesting discussions about community, and potential micro services design, I&rsquo;m adding a couple of elements to my microservice definition list.</p>
<p>In my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/17/more-pondering-on-my-own-microservice-definition/">last post</a>&nbsp;on this, I listed seven criteria I congress as part of my micro services definition:</p>
<ul>
<li>minimal surface</li>
<li>minimal on disk</li>
<li>minimal compute</li>
<li>minimal message</li>
<li>minimal network</li>
<li>minimal time to rebuild</li>
<li>minimal time to throw away</li>
</ul>
<p>I wanted to add two elements to my list, considering some of the other elements I&rsquo;ve noticed at play when it comes to API bloat:</p>
<ul>
<li>minimal ownership</li>
<li>minimal dependencies</li>
</ul>
<p>Minimal owners is a pretty easy one for me, as I&rsquo;m the owner of all my microservices&mdash;the buck always stops with me. However, It is a good reminder to make sure all of my services have a vCard applied to their <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.son file index</a>. It is important to easily known who is responsible for any public or private API, and with APIs.son and Swagger, this is easy to do.</p>
<p>When it comes to minimal dependencies, this gets a little tougher for me. My world isn&rsquo;t too bad, because my systems are small, and I&rsquo;ve been the only developer.  The down side is I&rsquo;ve been the only developer, and I&rsquo;ve bee lazy about how many dependencies an API might have, and also been fairly sloppy about how I integrate with 3rd party APIs. Adding this item to my list will help me keep an eye on how I establish dependencies between services, keeping them minimal, and well documented.</p>
<p>That is it, I just wanted to add ownership and dependencies to my list of considerations&mdash;I just like making a production out of everything.</p>
