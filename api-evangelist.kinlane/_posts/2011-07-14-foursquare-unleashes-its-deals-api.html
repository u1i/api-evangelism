<p></p>The new Merchant API comes right after their <a title="announcements of national partnership with American Express" href="http://blog.foursquare.com/2011/06/23/american-express-specials-now-for-everyone-nationwide/">announcement of a national partnership with American Express</a>, and the new API will make it even easier for other merchant partners to create deals using foursquare.
<p></p>It looks like foursquare is depending on its 10,000-strong developer community to take on Facebook and Groupon in the deal-making space.
