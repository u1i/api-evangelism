<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/10/27/api-monitoring-should-be-baked-into-your-api-strategy-by-default/">I love that AWS is baking monitoring testing by default in the new Amazon API Gateway</a>. I am also seeing new service from AWS, and Google providing security and testing services for your APIs, and other infrastructure. It just makes sense for cloud platforms to incentivize security of their platforms, but also ensure wider success through the performance and load testing of APIs as well.</p>
<p>As I'm reading through recent releases, and posts, I'm thinking about the growth in <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/">monitoring</a>, <a href="http://testing.apievangelist.com/">testing</a>, and <a href="http://performance.apievangelist.com">performance</a> services targeting APIs, and the convergence with a growth in the number of approaches to API <a href="http://virtualization.apievangelist.com">virtualization</a>, and what <a href="http://containers.apievangelist.com">containers</a> are doing to the API space. I feel like Amazon baking in monitoring and testing into API deployment and management because it is in their best interest, but is also something I think providers could go even further when it comes to investment in this area.</p>
<p>What if you could establish a stage of your operations, such as QA, or maybe production testing, and the compute and bandwidth costs associated with operations in these stages were significantly discounted? Kind of like the difference in storage levels between Amazon S3 and Glacier, but designed specifically to encourage monitoring, testing, and performance on API deployments.</p>
<p>Maybe AWS is already doing this and I've missed it. Regardless it seems like an interesting way that any API service provider could encourage customers to deliver better quality APIs, as well as help give a boost to the overall API testing, monitoring, and performance layer of the sector. #JustAThought</p>
