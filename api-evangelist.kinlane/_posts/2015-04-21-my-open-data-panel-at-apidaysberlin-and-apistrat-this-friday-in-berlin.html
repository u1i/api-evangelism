<p>In addition to helping be the MC for the API event, one of the conversation I am facilitating at&nbsp;<a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/">@APIDaysBerlin / @APIStrat Europe this Friday in Berlin</a>, is an open data discussion on the main stage. What better place to discuss the world of open data and API, then in Germany. The country has some of the strictest laws when it comes to protecting the privacy of German citizens, and when it comes to API access to data, I couldn't think of a better place to have an open discussion in 2015.</p>
<p>I have invited two data specialists to the stage Friday afternoon:</p>

<p>I am looking forward to hearing what Ali and Jonathan have to say about open data, from a European perspective. To help stimulate the conversation, I've also invited one of our keynotes to join us:</p>

<p>I do not have a list of questions prepared for these gentlemen. I think we all know the space well enough, just discussing who they are, their projects, and the wider open data space is sure to fill up 30 minutes of main stage action. I am eager to hear Chris's keynote as well, as I'm extremely interested in what <a href="https://opencorporates.com/">OpenCorporates</a> is doing.</p>
<p><a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/#tile_registration">If you aren't registered, there are like 20 tickets left, so you better jump now before the conference sells out</a>. Feel free to send me any questions or topics you'd like to see disccussed, and I'll see you in Berlin this Friday and Saturday.</p>
