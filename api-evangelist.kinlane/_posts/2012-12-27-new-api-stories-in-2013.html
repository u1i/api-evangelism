<p>Storytelling in the API industry is critical to the healthy growth of the space.  John Musser and <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a> have been telling great stories in the tech industry, since way before APIs were all lthe rage they are now.</p>
<p>While I was at <a title="API Days" href="http://apidays.io">API Days</a> this year,  I was speaking with Mike Amundsen (<a href="https://twitter.com/mamund">@mamund</a>) of <a href="http://www.layer7tech.com/">Layer7</a>, and we started talking about how Amazon, Netflix (and I&rsquo;d add Twilio) tend to dominate the API discussion.  I considered my talks from API Days, and sure enough--Netflix and Amazon were in there multiple times!</p>
<p>There are other stories we tell around Twitter, Facebook Google and other smaller APIs, but Amazon, Netflix and Twilio were cornerstones of API folklore in 2012.  While I will keep telling these pillar stories (because they matter), as well as evolving other pioneers from my <a title="history of APIs" href="/history/">history of APIs</a> section, I want to develop a fresh lineup of amazing API stories for 2013.</p>
<p>Stories like <a title="ohnson Control's, Panoptix API" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/12/17/make-an-impact-on-our-environment-using-apis/">Johnson Control's, Panoptix API</a>, and how a 125 year old company can change their culture and embrace a new way of doing business via APIs.</p>
<p>I will make sure there is easy access to the classic Amazon, Netflix and Twilio API stories.  I will also be adding new versions of some other classic stories from Salesforce, eBay, Flickr and other API pioneers.  But in 2013 I will be working to find a new set of API stories from brands and companies we know.</p>
<p>If you have an API success story you&rsquo;d like to share, please let me know.</p>
