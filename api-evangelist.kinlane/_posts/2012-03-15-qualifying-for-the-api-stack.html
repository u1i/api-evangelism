<p>I&rsquo;m going through hundreds of APIs and curating a list of APIs, for what I&rsquo;m calling the API Stack. &nbsp;The API Stack consists of APIs that provide clear value for developers and have demonstrated real investment in their API, and are in it for long haul.</p>
<p>There are quite a few things I consider when looking at an API, here are a few:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Value</strong> - The API offers clear value to developers, without needing an explanation.</li>
<li><strong>Web API</strong> - They don&rsquo;t have to be 100% REST, but web APIs make developers lives easier.</li>
<li><strong>Active Blog w/ RSS</strong> - A blog is a quick way to see what is behind the curtain of an API.  If they care enough to have a blog, and communicate with developers, and keep it active it demonstrates they care.  With an RSS feed I can programmatically understand whether they are active or not.</li>
<li><strong>Active Forum w/ RSS</strong> - A forum gives developers a voice and also shows an API owner cares what developers thinks, and is willing to support a large community.  An active forum is a positive sign of an API, and the RSS feed also gives me a programmatic way to assess.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter</strong> - An active Twitter presence is a pretty key metric in understanding the value of an API.  If the company has the resources to actively engage developers via Twitter, they care.  And again I can programmatically monitor and see if someone exists behind the API.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other metrics I use, but these are proving to be the most positive characteristics of an API that developers can depend on.  Many APIs I come across don&rsquo;t even meet these basic requirements.  What triggered this post, was I had just looked at about 10 APIs that did not meet these basic requirements, and then I came across one that clearly met all of these, and more--<a href="http://www.geoiq.com/">GeoIQ</a>.</p>
<p>GeoIQ has a mapping API that provides clear value to developers, and its obvious they are investing the necessary resources, so the API is successful.  So I&rsquo;m adding GeoIQ to my API stack under the category of &ldquo;local&rdquo;.</p>
<p>If you feel your API is a good fit for the API stack, make sure and ping me.</p>
