<p><a title="Pioneer Corporation" href="http://pioneer.jp/">Pioneer Corporation</a> just announced the availability of Zypr&trade;, a new voice-powered API that  provides a conversational, voice-control command API allowing developers to integrate <a title="Siri" href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/siri.html">Siri</a> like functionality into their own applications.</p>
<p>The <a title="Zypr API" href="http://www.zypr.net/">Zypr API</a> provides a single RESTful API for developers to access voice UI, maps and routing, local search, social networking, music and radio, contacts, calendars and weather from multiple service providers, including:  Facebook, Twitter, Google, Yelp, AccuWeather, INRIX real-time and predictive traffic information, Slacker Radio, Tuner2 Radio, Wcities, xAd and VoiceBox.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve covered <a title="unified and aggregate APIs" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/09/13/unified-data-apis-for-geo,-weather-and-beyond/">unified and aggregate APIs</a> in the past, where within maturing industries like social and cloud computing, service providers are stepping up with a single API to work with multiple providers.  Zypr is similar in that it offers a single API for multiple providers, but uses voice as the mechanism for search.   Zypyr&rsquo;s goal is to normalize, stable and voice-enhanced method for accessing a wide array of constantly changing APIs, Zypr can reduces the impact of service-specific API changes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pioneer created Zypr so that any type of developer or device maker on any platform can easily offer compelling new services to enhance their own technology and brand equity,&rdquo; said Susumu Kotani, the president of Pioneer Corporation. &ldquo;We have also changed the rules by allowing developers and device makers alike the opportunity to share in revenue when they deploy Zypr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition to providing revenue sharing opportunities, the Zypr API is available at no chrage to developers.  You can access documentation, code, sample application and other developer tools at <a title="Zyprnet" href="http://www.zypr.net/">www.zypr.net</a>.</p>
<p>With a simple, but powerful RESTful API and the buzz around <a title="Siri" href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/siri.html">Siri</a>, Apples new voice tasking system , the Zypr API is sure to be a hit.  If Pioneer Corporation can successfully evangelize the Zypr API and get it into the hands of hackers and developer globally, it could easy become the <a title="Twilio" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/apis/twilio.php">Twilio</a> of voice tasking.</p>
