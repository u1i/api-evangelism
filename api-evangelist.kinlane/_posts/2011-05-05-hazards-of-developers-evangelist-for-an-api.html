<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/mimeo/mimeo_connect_logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />I'm working to make it easier to get up and running using the Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API.<p></p>
One concept that is tough to understand at first, is that all printing starts with a Mimeo document.<p></p>
Then using the API you can either order that document as is, or merge one or many PDF documents with it, generate a dynamic document, then order this new document.<p></p>
As part of our API, we have a Document Listing Service, except it only pulls documents from a central account I have control of.<p></p>
So if you want to pull one of the documents you created, you have to actually pull the Document ID from your My Mimeo account.<p></p>
Sounds easy right?  Well its available in the URL, and in a properties screen for the document.<p></p>
The Document ID is a GUID, for those of you who don't know what a GUID is:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>A globally unique identifier or GUID (pronounced /??u??d/ or /??w?d/) is a unique reference number used as an identifier in computer software</em>
<em>So a Document ID looks like this:</em>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>3F2504E0-4F89-11D3-9A0C-0305E82C3301</em>
Except for some reason the one that shows in My Mimeo is missing the dashes, and doesn't work when you pass through the API.<p></p>
So I ask my API developer, where is the easiest place to get the Document ID?<p></p>
He says, "In the URL or as property of document".<p></p>
I explain it doesn't work without dashes.<p></p>
His response is, Developers will understand, and know to put dashes back in.<p></p>
And that is a hazard of putting developers as the public face of your API.<p></p>
They make a lot of assumptions based upon what they know.<p></p>
API Evangelists and developer advocates should definitely have programming skills, but ideally they should have a balance of proramming, business and marketing skills.
