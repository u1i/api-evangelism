<p><span>As part of my&nbsp;</span><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/16/api-design-do-you-swagger-blueprint-or-raml/">research in the world of API design</a><span>, I&rsquo;m looking into the different approaches by API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger, to provide API definitions, services and tools that assist developers in better designing APIs. I have already look at the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/22/the-evolving-motivations-behind-api-definitions/">evolving motivations behind API definitions</a><span>, and some insight into the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/31/the-vision-behind-swagger-api-blueprint-and-raml/">vision behind Swagger, API Blueprint and RAML</a>, next up is taking a look at the tooling that is emerged around each approach.</p>
<p>I began with a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/25/api-design-tooling-from-swagger/">look at the tooling around Swagger</a>, and next up is to look at <a href="http://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, from <a href="http://apiary.io/">Apiary.io</a>,&nbsp;which is centered around a markdown based API definition language:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a> -</strong> Apiary.io&rsquo;s API definition language designed to allow anyone, not just developers to design APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>To put API Blueprint to use, Apiary provides a parser:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/apiaryio/snowcrash">Snowcrash</a> -</strong> The API Blueprint parser built on top of the Sundown Markdown parser</li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to tooling around API Blueprint, it is all about the Apiary.io platform:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Apiary.io -</strong> Collaborative design, instant API mock, generated documentation, integrated code samples, debugging and automated testing</li>
</ul>
<p>Apiary.io delivers the features we are seeing emerge around Swagger and RAML, and more:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Server Mock - </strong>Providing a mock API interface allowing you to experiment with an API interface before you write any code</li>
<li><strong>Interactive Documentation </strong>- Auto generated API documentation that allows developers to authenticate and make live calls to an API while learning the documentation</li>
<li><strong>GitHub Sync -</strong> Apiary uses Github to store each API Blueprint, allowing it to be stored publicly or privately on Github, with automatic updating of API docs with each Github commit</li>
<li><strong>Command Line Tools -</strong> A separate command-line interface available as ruby gem, allowing for the automation and integration of API Blueprints it your regular workflow</li>
<li><strong>Traffic Inspector -</strong> Providing a proxy to run API calls through allowing the breakdown of each call to APIs, helping developers understand and debug APIs much easier</li>
<li><strong>Discussion</strong> - Communication tools within API blueprint documentation allowing team and public developer conversations</li>
</ul>
<p>I did find two other open tools for API Blueprint:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/apiaryio/gavel">HTTP Call Validator</a></strong> - Gavel is a tool for deciding which HTTP API call is valid and which is not</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/apiaryio/dredd">API Blueprint Testing Tool</a> </strong>- Dredd is a command-line tool for testing API documentation written in API Blueprint format against its backend implementation.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;d say that Apiary with API Blueprint was the first company dedicated specifically to API design. Swagger was born as a set of tools out of Wordnik, and not designed to be a product, with RAML coming later.  While Swagger was pushing API design into new areas beyond just interactive docs, Apiary and API Blueprint was the first API design only startup to emerge.</p>
<p>During 2006-2012, API management was being standardized by pioneers like Mashery, 3Scale and Apigee--now API design is now being defined by providers like Swagger, &nbsp;API Blueprint, and RAML. It shows that the API space is continueing to expand and mature, increasing the need to refine not just API design, but the overall API lifecycle.&nbsp;</p>
