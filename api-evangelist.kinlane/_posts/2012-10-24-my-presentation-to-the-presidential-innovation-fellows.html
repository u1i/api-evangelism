<p>I spent two hours with a handful of the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows">Presidential Innovation Fellows</a> in Washington DC yesterday.  They were some super savvy folks from a wide variety of agencies and backgrounds including education, energy and health.</p>
<p>During my two hours with them I walked through several areas of  the API industry, from my perspective, including:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>History of APIs</li>
<li>API Planning &amp; Design</li>
<li>API Development</li>
<li>Business of APIs</li>
<li>API Service Providers</li>
<li>API Tools, Services, Platforms</li>
<li>Politics of APIs</li>
<li>API Evangelism</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s Next for APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>You can access my <a href="/federal-digital-strategy/innovation-fellows/">innovation fellows presentation off API Evangelist</a>, I&rsquo;ll leave it up permanently.  It&rsquo;s minus all my commentary and banter, but hopefully it will give you an idea of what I covered.  If you&rsquo;d like a custom presentation on it, let me know and I&rsquo;ll see if I can find a slot to do a Google Hangout.</p>
<p>I had a blast talking to the Presidential Fellows, and I hope that I left them with some value that will help them be successful in their various initiatives.  They are already halfway through their sprint, and have a lot of expectations put on them.</p>
<p>I will be following their progress closely and publish any stories I can on their progress.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span></p>
