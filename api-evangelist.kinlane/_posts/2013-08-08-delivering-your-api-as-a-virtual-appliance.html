<p>Sentiment analysis and social media analytics API provider <a href="https://www.repustate.com/" target="_blank">Repustate</a> is providing a <a href="http://blog.repustate.com/provisioning-virtual-appliances-with-vagrant/2013/08/03/">virtualized, portable, on-premise version of its API</a>--adding a new twist to the concept of API deployment.</p>
<p>Using this new approach, Repustate is targeting the 5% of their user base who do not wish to transmit their data across the Internet, possibly because of legal or security concerns, and providing them with an on-premise version of their API, configured as a portable virtual appliance.</p>
<p>While the concept of on-premise vs cloud is nothing new, packaging up your API as a virtual appliance that can run anywhere is not that common.  I'm investigating various, emerging <a title="approaches to deploying virtualized containers" href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/07/15/virtual-containers-stacks-apis-and-application-management/">approaches to deploying virtual containers</a> that can assist API providers in providing portable versions of their valuable API resources.</p>
<p>At this point, I'm not sure how much demand there is for on-premise API resources, but I could see huge potential for the deployment of <a title="virtualized api stacks" href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">virtualized API stacks</a> within a corporate firewall, enough that I will keep highlighting interesting approaches like Repustates, and providing blueprints for designing and deploying virtualized API containers and appliances.</p>
