<p>I don't spend a lot of time worrying about the website traffic numbers for API Evangelist. Once a week I'll take a look at my Google Analytics or CloudFlare dashboards. I don't write for page views, but I do like to know which of my areas of research is of interest to the public, and generally what people are clicking on.</p>
<p>To help me visit my numbers each week, I started publishing them to <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-evangelist">the API Evangelist </a><a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-evangelist">repo</a>, and sharing via a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/numbers/">new numbers section</a> on the site.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wanted to start with seeing the page views across all of my API research projects, giving me an idea of the interest levels in each area:</p>

<p>Next, I wanted to see the page views that each guide or white paper was getting in the top left corner of my site:</p>

<p>After the views, I wanted to get a better understanding of what people were clicking on when it came to&nbsp;these guides &amp; white papers:</p>

<p>I also wanted to see which of the sponsor logos I include on the left-hand navigation were being clicked on by my readers:</p>

<p>Numbers do not drive what I do. I research and write about what grabs my attention, not based upon what drives traffic. However, I do like sharing these basic numbers with my partners, and readers, so that they can get a feel for my reach, and what areas of my research are of interest to the public.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/numbers/">The numbers reports are simple static views of activity across my sites</a>. I will publish the JSON that drives the reports each week, along with the rest of my industry monitoring each week. Once I get enough data published to do some quarterly reports I will work to slice and dice, and see what I can come up with when it comes to visualizations. I'm enjoying playing with D3.js as a visual layer to the JSON data that I'm publishing to Github, across my API industry research--the problem is that I can get lost for hours doing this.</p>
