<p>One of the <a href="http://api.report/2014/10/07/hacker-news-launches-official-api/">API news story of the day was the release of the Hacker News API</a>. I&rsquo;m only lightly interested in the fact that HN now has an API because, honestly I don't feel like an API at this point in the evolution of tech curation site is something to applaud, but their approach to making their API real-time I think does subtly reflect other currents in the API space.</p>
<p>HN partnered with <a href="https://www.firebase.com/">Firebase</a> to make sure the tech news curation site doesn't just have an API, it has a real-time API. Meaning you can now get HN links in machine readable way, so that you can build the popular flow of tech information into other web, and mobile applications&mdash;in real-time! HN launching an API&hellip;yawn! HN launch an API with Firebase bkked in, reflects a growing trend from influential APIs. For me this is more about real-time and Firebase, than it is about HN.</p>
<p>You see <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/27/nest-provides-a-realtime-layer-by-default-for-api-consumers/">other API providers like Nest from Google baking in real-time frameworks into their APIs</a>. Real-time isn&rsquo;t something every type of API should be considering as a default feature, but there are definitely areas where the real-time flow of data is not just a nice to have, it is essential to demonstrating the value of APIs. In my experience, I would say that there are several sectors like news, financial, Internet of Things where I'm seeing real-time being present as a fundamental ingredient for the API platform--something I will be keeping an eye on.</p>
<p>As I said before, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/21/what-i-have-been-calling-api-trends-are-slowly-being-baked-into-api-operations/">some of the trends I&rsquo;m tracking on are quickly moving from trend to being baked into APIs</a>, going beyond just the release of web APis, and adding additional layers that developers are demanding to deliver the features their end-users are demanding.</p>
