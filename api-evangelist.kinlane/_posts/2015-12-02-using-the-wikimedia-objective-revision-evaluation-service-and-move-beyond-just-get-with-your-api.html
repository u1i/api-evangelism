<p>I stumbled across&nbsp;<a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Objective_Revision_Evaluation_Service">Objective Revision Evaluation Service (ORES)</a>&nbsp;last night,&nbsp;a web service running in Wikimedia Labs that provides machine learning as a service across Wikimedia Projects, and is d<span>esigned to help automate vandalism detection and removal for content, being developed as part of the&nbsp;</span><a title="Research:Revision scoring as a service" href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Revision_scoring_as_a_service">R:Revision scoring as a service</a><span>&nbsp;project.</span></p>
<p>As I came across, I was also considering <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">different access plans across my APIs</a>, with some of the plans allowing for updating existing content in the system--<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/29/the-bad-actors-on-both-sides-of-the-api-fence/">the topic of abuse of API access was on my mind</a>. I'm curious if ORES could be applied to any sort of content or data post via a PUT / PATCH API request?</p>
<p><span>Even if it didn't 100% out of the repo, maybe it could it be evolved to help manage the PUT / PATCH layer of API operations, allowing platforms to open up a little bit more, and open up more of their HTTP verbs, to a wider audience. Something like this could go a long way to helping API providers secure, and stabilize their API operations, and loosen service composition restrictions a little further.</span></p>
<p><span>Just a thought, as I'm kicking the tires of some of the open source API offerings I come across. Seems like to me, there is an opportunity for someone to deploy these open solutions as a service, and help API providers open up a little more. Just sharing with my audience, as a possible service that would benefit the API space, and hopefully make someone a little beer money--who knows!</span></p>
