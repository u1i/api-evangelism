<p>The first #APIStrat video is here!</p>
<p>For those of you who couldn't make it to the APIStrat in New York last February, or in case you missed some of the sessions, the videos are finally starting to come out.</p>
<p>The first video is from Laura Merling (<a href="https://twitter.com/magicmerl" target="_blank">@magicmerl</a>), VP Ecosystems and Solutions at AT&amp;T, from her talk <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Enterprise-Platform" target="_blank">3 Things You Need to Turn Your Enterprise Into A Platform</a>.</p>
<p>All the sessions were recorded and are being edited, and they will ALL be gradually posted during the next following weeks. Publishing order will be the same as in the original program, with the only exception of the keynotes being published first.</p>
<p>We will be linking the videos available from our website, on the <a title="apistrat sessions page" href="http://apistrategyconference.com/2013NYC/sessions.php">sessions page</a>. &nbsp;You can also find all the <a href="http://www.infoq.com/api-strategy-practice-2013/">videos and slides on InfoQ API Strategy &amp; Practice page</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you <a title="InfoQ" href="http://www.infoq.com/">InfoQ</a> for taking care of the filming, editing and publishing.</p>
