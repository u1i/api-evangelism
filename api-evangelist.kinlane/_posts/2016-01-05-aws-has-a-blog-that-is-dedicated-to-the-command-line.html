<p><a href="https://blogs.aws.amazon.com/cli/">Amazon has a new blog dedicated to just their Command Line Interface (CLI)</a>. I use AWS as anchor for many of my API stories, but I also acknowledge that many API providers will never be at the scale of AWS, but nonetheless I am drawn to the regular streams of lessons available via the cloud platform, if you look in the cracks.</p>
<p>The new AWS CLI blog is one of these. I do not think all API providers should run out and start a separate blog for their CLI, but the existence of a dedicated CLI blog at AWS shows the significance of CLI to the API world. If you are looking to court the enterprise, and many other developer groups, a CLI should be a very relevant tool in your toolbox. If a platform interface is not also available via a CLI, you might be missing an entire segment of the developer community.</p>
<p>Like with my <a href="http://ide.apievangelist.com/">IDE</a>, and <a href="http://sdk.apievangelist.com/">SDK</a> research, I may be firing up a separate area for CLI. I regularly curated CLI focused conversation, services, and tooling during my monitoring, making it a good candidate for isolation into its own research project. Part of the reason in isolating into its own research, is that the topic will get regular attention from me, and a single repo for storing my research, which means the chances my understanding around the topic will increase greatly.</p>
