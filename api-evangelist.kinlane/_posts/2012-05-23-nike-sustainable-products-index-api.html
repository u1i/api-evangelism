<p>Nike is working on a new API as part of their <a title="Nike Better World initative" href="http://www.nikebetterworld.com/">Nike Better World initative</a>.  The <a title="API provides access to a materials sustainability index" href="http://nikemsiapi.nikebetterworld.com/">API provides access to a materials sustainability index</a>, which evaluates the environmental impact of materials used by manufacturers.</p>
<p>The scoring system evaluates the environmental impacts of materials used in products using a combination of materials-specific data, covering areas such as Chemistry, Energy and Greenhouse Gas Intensity, Water and Land Use Intensity, and Waste.</p>
<p>The <a title="Nike Materials Sustainability Index API" href="http://nikemsiapi.nikebetterworld.com/">Nike Materials Sustainability Index API</a> is only in alpha stage right now, and is undergoing for a peer review process with Duke University.  You can follow their <a title="Nike Makers Blog" href="http://nikemakers.tumblr.com/">Nike Maker&rsquo;s Blog</a> to get more information on the initiative and get notified when the API will be available to the public.</p>
