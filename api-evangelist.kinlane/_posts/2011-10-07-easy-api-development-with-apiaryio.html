<p>I'm spending a lot of time lately evaluating the various API management service providers like <a title="3Scale" href="/serviceproviders/3scale.php">3Scale</a>, <a title="Apigee" href="/serviceproviders/apigee.php">Apigee</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Mashery" href="/serviceproviders/mashery.php">Mashery</a>,and&nbsp;<a title="Mashape" href="/serviceproviders/mashape.php">Mashape</a>.</p>
<p>One thing that I have to explain a lot to people about these API management services&hellip;is they are API management services.  Not API deployment services.</p>
<p>The only one provider that has a solution to deploy your API is <a title="Mashape" href="/serviceproviders/mashape.php">Mashape</a>, but now there is a new provider gearing up, called <a title="Apiary.io" href="http://apiary.io/">Apiary.io</a>.  Apiary.io wants to make developing and implementing APIs a quicker process.</p>
<p>Apiary.io site says they will also help you describe, test, manage and share your API with developers.</p>
<p>I feel that API deployment services is a huge opportunity in this space, its good to see a provider step up that will help API owners deploy their APIs, as well as manage them.</p>
<p><a title="Apiary.io" href="http://apiary.io/">Apiary.io</a> is still in private Beta, so I can't take it for a spin yet.  It will be interesting to learn more about what this latest API service provider can bring to the table.</p>
