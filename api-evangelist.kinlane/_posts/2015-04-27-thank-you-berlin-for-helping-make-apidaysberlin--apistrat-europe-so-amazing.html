<p>I am still coming off the high that was&nbsp;<a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/">@APIDaysBerlin / @APIStrat Europe</a> this last April 23rd through 25th in Berlin. There were a number of talks that I enjoyed, ranging from open data, to 3D printing, to hypermedia--too many to list. I love the German view of technology, data privacy, and generally on what is going on in the United States.</p>
<p>Other than the wifi issues, the conference was a success. We sold out the event, with 450 people in attendance (goal was 400), and even with the final day being on a Saturday, the turnout was very impressive. Each session I ran, was full of questions, with an IoT session, and another architecture session running 10 minutes over, because there were so many good questions, I didn't want to stop.</p>

<p>We are processing the videos from the conference, which I will spend time watching each one--telling stories along the way. So keep an eye out on API Evangelist, and on the <a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/category/blog/">@APIStrat blog</a> for each video release, as we will be trickling them out as each video comes off the production line over the next couple of weeks. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you to 3Scale, APIDays, and Commerce Tools to for making sure this amazing event came together. I'm just now getting my brain back in gear, so look for more &nbsp;@APIDaysBerlin / @APIStrat stories over next couple weeks!</p>

<p>Thank you so much Berlin! I look forward to coming back for the next event.</p>
