<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/npr-logo.jpg" alt="" align="right" />Twitter has been working hard lately to <a title="define the rules of the road for the Twitter API" href="http://dev.twitter.com/pages/api_terms">define the rules of the road for the Twitter API</a> ecosystem.<p></p>
When it comes to monetizing content and media, there are many differing opinions and by extension there are many approaches to managing an API ecosystem.<p></p>
NPR's approach is innovative, <a title="making incremental changes in technology and business rules" href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/inside/2011/03/17/134259537/the-npr-api-an-engine-rebuild?ft=1&amp;f=91000411">making incremental changes in technology and business rules</a>.<p></p>
<a title="National Public Radio" href="http://www.npr.org">NPR</a> is improving its API technology to be easier to use, run faster, and deliver all types of content better.<p></p>
NPR is also innovating around digital rights management, to support their <a title="Ingest System" href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/inside/2010/04/22/126205655/building-the-ingest-system">Ingest System</a> which allows partners to publish content into the NPR system.<p></p>
Managing digital rights and content has its own challenges, but you throw in APIs -- the ability for partners to publish and developers to access this content -- it can't be easy.<p></p>
It's good to see NPR openly talking about the challenges they face, and their ideas on how they are going to keep improving the <a title="NPR API" href="http://www.npr.org/api/index">NPR API</a> ecosystem.
