<p>I wish I had more time to spend on designing, and deploying APIs the way I desired. Without any real funding of individual APIs, I can only go so far with them, which usually doesn't go beyond the minimal viable API. However, even with this reality, I have two APIs I would love to see done right, and keep nagging at me.</p>
<p>One API is my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/curated/">curated news API</a>, which I currently have a pretty bare bones JSON definition to represent each news article I curate from the API space (date, title, author, body, url). As I have time, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/05/11/applying-a-little-hypermedia-is-helping-me-tighten-down-my-api-design-and-tell-a-better-api-story/">I've been trying to craft a Siren representation of this same resource</a>. The opportunities for exploration of my archive of curated API news going back to 2011 is pretty huge (in my opinion).</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/audio/">I've also been having delusions of a hypermedia enabled version of my audio API</a>, which I use store audio files I find, create, or publish. It is a CRUD version of what I'd like to see, but recently I've been thinking of ways I could craft a more audible version of API Evangelist, but in order to do it right, I need a hypermedia enabled API experience.</p>
<p>For me, ,this takes hypermedia beyond many of the discussions I have been exposed to, moving my motivations into the realm of user experience, and not about building a client that will rule them all, or just as a matter of principle--I just want to deliver the right experience. How do I allow consumers of my audio API to define their own experience? How do I craft some experiences, based upon my view of the API space--as I see the world?</p>
<p>This is where hypermedia goes beyond the technical, and moves into the experiential realm where I'm hoping that I can manifest some more money to pay for tehse API designs to become a reality. ;-) Thank you for your support!</p>
