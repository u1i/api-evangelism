<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/events/gluecon.jpg" alt="" align="right" />I'm preparing for a talk tomorrow at the <a title="Glue Conference" href="http://gluecon.com/2011/">Glue conference</a> in Colorado. Glue is a conference that assists architects, developers, administrators and integrators in solving problems around web application integration.
<p></p>Glue is about all of bits and pieces, APIs and meta-data, standards and connectors that will help us to glue together the varying applications of the new platform.
<p></p>I'm joining <a title="Justin Tormey" href="http://twitter.com/#!/justintormey">Justin Tormey</a>, Director, Customer Evangelism - Open API Platform at Alcatel-Lucent to present a session called <a title="Finishing School for Potential API Providers" href="http://gluecon.com/2011/?page_id=16">Finishing School for Potential API Providers</a>.
<p></p>The outline for our session is:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>If you build it... they won't come
     </li>
     <li>Common Building Blocks
     </li>
     <li>Innovative Building Blocks
     </li>
     <li>Developer ? Developer
     </li>
     <li>Monetization

     </li>
