<p>I look at a lot of API developers areas in my work, and the first sign I see that nobody is home behind an API, is that their blog is out of date.</p>
<p>I found myself at the <a href="http://developer.espn.com/blog">ESPN developer center</a> last night, clicked on the blog, which has a great tag line of &ldquo;API-focused musings and rambling&rdquo;, but alas hasn't been updated in over a year.</p>
<p>Your API developer blog posts do not have to be anything master planned, and should just be thoughts from the daily life of running your API. A little effort goes a long way on your API developer blog, and when it becomes out of date, it also will send a strong signal to developers&mdash;nobody is home, don&rsquo;t use this API.</p>
<p>Make sure your API-focused musing and ramblings occur more than once very year, I know that personally I need it daily, but maybe you need it a little less frequent. ;-)</p>
