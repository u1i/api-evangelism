<p>I'm doing a lot more API deployments from dead simple data sources since I started working in the federal government. As part of these efforts I'm working to put together a simple toolkit that newbies to the API world can use to rapidly deploy APIs as well.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago I worked through the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/22/api-deployment-from-mysql-json-github-and-google-spreadsheets/">simple, open API implementations</a>, and this week <span>I want to show how to secure access to the API by requiring an AppID and AppKey which will allow you to track on who has access to the API.</span></p>
<p>I'm using <a href="http://bit.ly/1cHBhd5">3Scale API Management</a> infrastructure to secure the demos. 3Scale has a free base offering that allows anyone to get up and running requiring API keys, analytics and other essentials with very little investment.</p>
<p>Currently I have four separate deployment blueprints done:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/11/16/deploy-secure-api-mysql-to-api/">MySQL to API</a></li>
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/11/16/deploy-secure-api-json-to-api/">Local JSON to API</a></li>
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/11/16/deploy-secure-api-public-google-spreadsheet-to-api/">Public Google Spreadsheet to API</a></li>
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/11/16/deploy-secure-api-private-google-spreadsheet-to-api/">Private Google Spreadsheet to API</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All of these samples are in PHP and uses the <a href="http://www.slimframework.com/">Slim PHP REST framework</a>. They are meant to be working examples that you can use to seed your own API deployment.</p>
<p>You can find the entire <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-deploy-toolkit">working repository</a>, including Slim framework at Github.</p>
