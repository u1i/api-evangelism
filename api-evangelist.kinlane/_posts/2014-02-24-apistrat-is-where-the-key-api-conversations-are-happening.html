<p>I&rsquo;m working with Phil Legetter (<a href="https://twitter.com/leggetter">@leggetter</a>) to put together a panel at API Strategy &amp; Practice in Amsterdam on APIs and realtime, and as I&rsquo;m working to bring together the leaders from the space together, I can&rsquo;t help but think of past APIStrat panels. At APIStrat we are looking to pull together the leaders from different business sectors and have a conversation on where we are, and where things are going with trends like API aggregation, automation, design, BaaS and realtime.</p>
<p>At <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Mobile-Back-end-Service">APIStrat, NYC 203 we brought together the leaders from the backend as a service (BaaS) space,</a> including <span>Ilya Sukhar (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/ilyasu">@ilyasu</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.parse.com/" target="_blank">Parse</a><span>, Morgan Bickle (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/morganbickle">@morganbickle</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.kinvey.com/" target="_blank">Kinvey</a><span>, Marc Weil (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/marcweil">@marcweil</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://cloudmine.me/" target="_blank">Cloudmine</a><span>, Miko Matasumura (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/mikojava">@mikojava</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="http://kii.com/" target="_blank">Kii</a><span>, Ty Amell (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/tyamell">@tyamell</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.stackmob.com/" target="_blank">StackMob</a><span>&nbsp;James Tamplin (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/jamestamplin">@jamestamplin</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.firebase.com/" target="_blank">Firebase</a>, resulting in a pretty interesting discuss about what is BaaS, and the future of the fast growing trend in using APIs for mobile development.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to March of 2014, Parse has been acquired by Facebook, Stackmob acquired by Paypal and shut-down just last week, and the speed at which the tech sector moves is really evident. I started tracking on BaaS in 2011, and just 3 years later the space has evolved fast&mdash;making conversations like the APIStrat BaaS panel critical in helping shape the industry.</p>
<p>As APIs + realtime technologies gain in popularity amongst startups and leading tech companies, its time to get together and have a conversation with leading tech companies in the realtime space like <a href="http://pusher.com/">Pusher</a>, <a href="http://www.pubnub.com/">Pubnub</a>, <a href="https://www.firebase.com/">Firebase</a>, and <a href="https://fanout.io/">Fanout.io</a> to name a few. Much like BaaS, the important conversations around key trends in API like realtime, will be occurring at APIStrat.</p>
<p>These conversations are why the <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale</a> team and API Evangelist put on #APIStrat, and look forward to you being part of these important discussions. Make sure you are <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/index.php">registered for API Strategy &amp; Practice in Amsterdam, March 26-28th</a>.</p>
