<p>
     <a title="Tru.ly" href="https://tru.ly">Tru.ly</a> just launched an <a title="Tru.ly" href="https://tru.ly">age verification API</a> that authenticates the age of an online user based by cross-referencing user-submitted personal information with data points from Tru.ly verification partners.
</p>
<p>
     Verification is done by matching user-submitted information with that in a national database of government and public data. In order to become verified, specific pieces of information must match. Tru.ly also uses a proprietary technology to flag users who may be trying to game the system.
</p>
<p>
     Using Tru.ly, websites with restricted content such as movies, alcohol and video games can programmatically verify its user’s ages, going beyond using just asking for a birth date.
</p>
<p>
     The API was developed to confirm an age while also promoting the guidelines set forth in the <a href="http://www.coppa.org/coppa">Children Online Privacy Protection Act</a> (COPPA), specifically section 1302-9, which defines verifiable parental consent as any reasonable effort, so as to ensure that the parent is aware of the website’s personal information collection, use, and disclosure practices.
