<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/3D-Printing/3d-printing-makers.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />Just like it takes <a title="creators" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printing-the-creators/">creators</a> to develop 3D models of physical objects, it takes makers, who are people that actually bring these virtual representations into the world.</p>
<p><a title="3D Printers" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printers-printers/">3D printers</a> do most of the work, but it takes someone who knows the machine, materials and process to bring these 3D models to life.</p>
<p>Many industries will adopt 3D printing, increasing the need for specialized talent understanding the needs of each sector, and how the printers, process and materials serve these sectors.</p>
<p>Creators will understand objects in a virtual format, and makers will understand them in a physical form.</p>
<p>3D printing is still a relatively new technology and will require constant improving as it evolves, makers will feed this evolution, and provide the knowledge to move the industry forward.</p>
<p>Makers are are another important human link in the evolving <a title="3D print and manufacturing supply chain" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printing-and-manufacturing-supply-chain/">3D print and manufacturing supply chain</a>.</p>
