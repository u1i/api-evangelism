<p>I have been talking with&nbsp;Nick Houghton over at <a href="https://getsandbox.com/docs/api/overview">Sandbox</a>&nbsp;about the state of OpenAPI Spec driven API documentation, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/25/we-should-be-generating-slate-from-swagger-so-we-maintain-a-machine-readable-core/">the lack of a machine-readable core when you deployed Slate driven documentation</a>. He was wanting the same thing--a good looking, dynamic API documentation that was OpenAPI Spec driven.</p>
<p>He recently got back to me&nbsp;and found a solution that worked for them: <em>"<a href="https://getsandbox.com/docs/api/overview">Ended up just templating the Swagger JSON myself rather than relying on Slate etc to do it. So model/resources are Swagger annotated, CI pushes out Swagger JSON and Angular UI </a></em><a href="https://getsandbox.com/docs/api/overview">parses</a><em><a href="https://getsandbox.com/docs/api/overview"> in the browser, works quite well I think</a>".</em></p>
<p>Nick is on a similar path that I am, as <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/08/playing-with-concepts-around-simplifying-the-api-docs-that-are-generated-using-api-definitions/">I work to simply API documentation using OpenAPI Spec</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/04/09/providing-specialized-views-of-an-api-surface-area-dynamically-with-openapi-spec-and-liquid/">provide specialized views of APIs using Liquid</a>. We are looking for the simplicity, control, and beauty of Slate, but the machine readable core of OpenAPI Spec--allowing us to keep the core specification for the API up to date, and the documentation is always the latest.</p>
<p>They are going to write up their journey on their blog (as all API service providers should), and share with us. I'll probably&nbsp;do another write-up once I get more details on how they created the templated API docs using OpenAPI Spec and Angular. I also like how they have the OpenAPI Spec JSON pushed out as part of the CI life-cycle--something I'll cover more as part of my <a href="http://orchestration.apievangelist.com/">API life-cycle orchestration research</a>.</p>
