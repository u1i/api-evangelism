<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you saw the big news last week, but <a title="software publisher Axway announced intent to acquire API service provider Vordel" href="http://www.vordel.com/company/axway_acquires_vordel.html">software publisher Axway announced intent to acquire API service provider Vordel</a>.  I&rsquo;m not a big fan of covering funding, acquisition or launch press releases, unless there a significant business story there.  But the acquisition of Vordel is another important sign for the API industry in 2012.</p>
<p>Financial terms of the deal haven&rsquo;t been disclosed, but the acquisition shows the API industry is maturing and producing desirable companies with proven API products, that larger software companies can use as a competitive advantage.  While Vordel's API management, SOA governance and identity management will help Axway&rsquo;s customers, I think Vordel&rsquo;s customers is probably the type of new client large software companies will want be also seeking out through acquisitions.</p>

<p>I always joke with John and Adam at <a href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a> about, &ldquo;Is this the year of the API&rdquo;? They have been at it longer than I have, and are very hesitant to dub any particular year, the year of the API.  But, with the growth we&rsquo;ve seen in 2012, two open source API management platforms deployed and now a major acquisition in the space--I confidently would say 2012 is the year APIs came of age.</p>
<p>I predict in 2013-2015 we are going to see more of these types of acquisitions occuring.  Large software companies are going to need a robust set of API tools to bring legacy systems into the modern, API driven economy.  Companies that have invested in API management service providers like <a title="3Scale" href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a> and <a title="Mashape" href="http://mashape.com">Mashape</a> will see the return they are looking for, as the space continues to grow in the next five years.</p>
