<p>I was working on series of API endpoints this week, each of them had a basic search parameter, allowing you pass a keyword to filter your API request.  Pretty standard stuff.</p>
<p>After deploying the APIs I wanted to make sure I tracked what people were searching for, so I could use in reporting and other tools. Then I got to thinking, that it would make sense to go ahead and launch an API of API search queries, allowing other users to be able to discover and benefit from insights derived from other API users searches.</p>
<p>Just a random thought as I'm playing around more with APIs in government. I definitely like the stimulation I get from designing, deploying and evolving APIs at my new gig, in addition to my existing monitoring of the API space.</p>
