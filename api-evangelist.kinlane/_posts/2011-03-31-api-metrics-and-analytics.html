These are common tools used across many industries and types of APIs to build their ecosystem.
<p></p>I hesitate to ever say any of these common building blocks are essential, because every API potentially has different requirements.
<p></p>However, one building block that is essential for <span class="c1">every</span> API, is metrics and analytics.
<p></p>API owners should me measuring every aspect of their API and its community, and be constantly reassessing their strategy based upon what is going on in real-time.
<p></p>API analytics is what service providers like <a title="Mashery" href="http://www.mashery.com">Mashery</a>, <a title="Apigee" href="http://www.apigee.com">Apigee</a> and <a href="http://www.3scale.net">3Scale</a> bring to the table. Mashery and Apigee proxy your API to deliver analytics, while 3Scale provides a plug to gather data for reporting on.
<p></p>All three of these providers charge you per transaction for this service. <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Google-Analytics-Charts-Stack.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /> To my knowledge there is no provider of an API analytics tool that is free, and plug and play.
<p></p>With the current explosion of APIs being deployed, there is a huge opportunity for someone to provide a free API analytics service that gathers and measures API usage.
<p></p>Think Google Analytics for APIs. A single line of server side code, with a variety of language kits, that will measure all requests on an API, its community, and provide a rich set of reports for API owners.
<p></p>This could probably be done with the <a title="Google Analytics API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/tracking/home.html">Google Analytics API</a>, I will have to play with more.
