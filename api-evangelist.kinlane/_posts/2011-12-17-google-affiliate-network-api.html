<p><a title="Google Affiliate Network API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/gan/index.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/google/Google-Affiliate-Network-API.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Google just launched their new <a title="Google Affiliate Network API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/gan/index.html">Google Affiliate Network API</a>, which allows publishers and advertisers to automate various tasks related to the <a title="Google Affiliate Network" href="http://www.google.com/affiliatenetwork">Google Affiliate Network</a>.</p>
<p>The Google Affiliate Network is the affiliate network, formerly known as Doubleclick Performics, which was part of <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/press/pressrel/doubleclick.html">Google&rsquo;s Doublick acquisition in April of 2007</a>.</p>
<p>Using the new Google Affiliate Network APIs, developers can programmaticaly manage:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Advertiser Lookup</strong> - Publishers can now use the Google Affiliate Network API to access data that advertisers have chosen to share with them.</li>
<li><strong>Event and Order Details</strong> - Developers can easily integrate data from events that occur in Google Affiliate Network into their own website's workflow and internal systems.</li>
<li><strong>Publisher Lookup</strong> - Advertisers can use the API to look up data that publishers have chosen to share with them</li>
</ul>
<p>I need to play with the network more to understand how it works from both an advertisers and publishers perspective.</p>
<p>It looks like an interesting addition to the suite of publishing, advertising and revenue generating tools from Google like <a title="Google Analytics" href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>, <a title="Google Adwords" href="https://adwords.google.com/">Google Adwords</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/v3/app">Google Adsense</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/">Google Webmaster Tools</a>.</p>
