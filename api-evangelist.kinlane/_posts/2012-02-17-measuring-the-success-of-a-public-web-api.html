<p><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/api-craft"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/API-Craft-Logo.png" alt="" align="right" /></a>I'm a member of a Google group called <a title="API Craft" href="http://groups.google.com/group/api-craft">API Craft</a>.  There are some really smart API folks talking about everything from API deployment to API business strategies there. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The other day someone in the groups asked:</p>
<blockquote><em><strong>How does someone measure success in developing and deploying a public&ndash;facing Web API?</strong></em></blockquote>
<p>Scott Regan (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/scottregan">@scottregan</a>) of <a title="Apigee" href="http://www.apigee.com">Apigee</a> gave a great response, and I wanted to share with everyone here.  Scott&rsquo;s suggestions for measurements were:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Revenue</strong> - For public APIs, could be affiliate program revenue, ad revenue, or if incremental traffic from apps to the website has a known monetization rate</li>
<li><strong>Reach</strong> -  Incremental new user accounts or unique users</li>
<li><strong>Partnerships</strong> - Number of new partnerships established around your API</li>
<li><strong>Apps</strong> - The number of new apps developed using your API</li>
<li><strong>Traffic</strong> - Apply percentage of incremental traffic ("our API channel is now X% of total internet traffic")</li>
<li><strong>Brand</strong> - Measuring increased 'brand', but only if the company has an really established way to do this</li>
</ul>
<p>Scott goes on to say:</p>
<blockquote><em>When it comes to business metric tracking one thing i've seen work well is when the  API team publishes a 'dashboard'  widely and regularly -   tracking actual results to estimates  -   because it helps PM focus the roadmap on what moves the business needle as agreed and avoid getting the team pulled in different directions.</em></blockquote>
<p>Each API could potentially have different success factors depending on the type of API or the goals of a company.  But revenue, reach, partnerships, apps, traffic and increased brand awareness are good places to start. &nbsp;Thanks Scott.</p>
