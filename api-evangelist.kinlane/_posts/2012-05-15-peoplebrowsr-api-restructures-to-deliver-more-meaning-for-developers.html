<p><a title="PeopleBrowsr Kred API" href="https://developer.peoplebrowsr.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/peoplebrowsr/kr_pb_logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Explaining to developers, what an API does, can be hard.  How you describe your API, the underlying endpoints, can make or break user adoption.  You shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid to evolve, and keep trying to find the sweet spot in both the language and branding that you use in your API area.</p>
<p>I saw an example of this today, with the restructuring of <a href="https://developer.peoplebrowsr.com/">PeopleBrowsr's APis</a>.  When I first starting playing with PeopleBrowsr's APIs, they were broken into 3 separate APIs:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>PeopleBrowsr API</li>
<li>Kredentials API</li>
<li>Kred API</li>
</ul>
<p>On the surface its really hard to know what each of these APIs does, but after I dove in I saw lots of value within individual methods, but I really had to spend time, getting to know each method, one by one.  I saw the value, but the structure and presentation of the PeopleBrowsr API area, and the way the interfaces were assembled, didn&rsquo;t immediately speak to this value.</p>
<p>Today they&rsquo;ve restructured their three APis into a single API, dubbed the <a title="PeopleBrowsr Kred API" href="https://developer.peoplebrowsr.com/">PeopleBrowsr Kred API</a>, and grouped all the API methods into four logical groups:</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/peoplebrowsr/kred-dashboard.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Find Influencers" href="https://developer.peoplebrowsr.com/find">Find Influencers</a></strong> -  Pinpoints influential people on any subject or within communities connected by shared interests or affinities.</li>
<li><strong><a title="Deep Analytics" href="https://developer.peoplebrowsr.com/deep">Deep Analytics</a></strong> -  Author-based analytics which includes Kredentials (a single-screen summary of anyone&rsquo;s social presence), historical Kred scores, reach, and friends &amp; followers. </li>
<li><strong><a title="Action Analytics" href="https://developer.peoplebrowsr.com/action">Action Analytics</a></strong> - Aggregated social data metrics for any keyword, hashtag or @name, including mention counts, word clouds and hashtag clouds.</li>
<li><strong><a title="Global Kred Score" href="https://developer.peoplebrowsr.com/kred">Global Kred Score</a></strong> - Appends global Kred scores to @names or twitter IDs in web-based applications. </li>
</ul>
<p>This new presentation immediately helps me understand which methods I should use based upon my goals.  PeopleBrowsr took the time to understand how developers were using their API, and worked to present the API in a way that best speaks to this.</p>
<p>PeopleBrowsr also took the time to understand the value delivered via their API in each of these new areas and restructure pricing to reflect this value:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Find Influencers -  $1.00 per call</li>
<li>Deep Analytics -  .10 cents per call</li>
<li>Action Analytics  - .01 cent per call</li>
<li>Global Kred Score  - Free</li>
</ul>
<p>Only time will tell if the new structure of the <a title="PeopleBrowsr Kred API" href="https://developer.peoplebrowsr.com/">PeopleBrowsr Kred API</a> will truly speak to developers that are looking to harvest insights from social media, but I like what they did to understand the needs of their developers, and work to better deliver the API presentation, documentation and pricing to reflect this need.</p>
<p>Make sure you are tuned into what your API developers are looking for and aren&rsquo;t afraid to evolve and better serve your developer community.</p>
