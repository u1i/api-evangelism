<p>Here we are going into June, and I still don&rsquo;t see a publicly available <a title="Pinterest" href="http://pinterest.com/" target="_blank">Pinterest</a> API.  Jay Yarow wrote in Business Insider back in February, "<a title="Pinterest's API Is Coming Soon, And VCs Are Super Excited" href="http://articles.businessinsider.com/2012-03-26/tech/31238519_1_mobile-apps-twitterrific-hootsuite">Pinterest's API Is Coming Soon, And VCs Are Super Excited</a>" and Adam Duvander wrote in ProgrammableWeb, "<a title="Pinterest API: Coming Soon or Already Here" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/02/09/pinterest-api-coming-soon-or-already-here/">Pinterest API: Coming Soon or Already Here</a>?".</p>
<p>There is also a <a title="reply to a Quora thread by Yashh Nelapati" href="http://www.quora.com/Pinterest/Is-there-an-API-for-Pinterest-that-allows-users-to-display-a-set-of-pins-photos-on-your-own-website">reply to a Quora thread by Yashh Nelapati</a>, Lead Engineer at Pinterest from May 2011, saying the API is 2-3 weeks away.  It&rsquo;s now a year later and there is no official API (<a title="rogue api" href="http://tijn.bo.lt/pinterest-api">there is a Rogue API</a>).</p>
<p><a title="Business Insider" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/">Business Insider</a> says, Pinterest fears having a <strong><em>"<a title="Twitter Problem" href="http://articles.businessinsider.com/2012-03-26/tech/31238519_1_mobile-apps-twitterrific-hootsuite">Twitter problem</a>&rdquo;</em></strong>.  Meaning that when Twitter released its API, it was still an immature company, allowing developers to build applications with features that it was missing--then Twitter matured, and it wanted to control its platform, it began adding building its own features and poaching from the Twitter API ecosystem.</p>
<p>So why not learn from Twitter and other APIs, and use the appropriate API building blocks to address this:</p>
<p><a title="Pinterest" href="http://pinterest.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/pinterest/Pinterest-Home-Page.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Branding Guidelines</strong> - Establish branding guidelines that clearly lays out what apps that use Pinterest API should look like</li>
<li><strong>UI / UX Toolkit</strong> - Provide a UI / UX toolkit like Twitter Bootstrap that sets the tone for applications built on the API</li>
<li><strong>Roadmap</strong> - Provide a real-time and transparent roadmap that developers can use to help keep their development efforts in line with Pinterest</li>
<li><strong>Developer Framework</strong> - Establish a developer framework outlining opportunities for developers to become stronger members of API community, also introducing possible investment and incubation of most success or important features</li>
<li><strong>Terms of Use</strong> - Establish a fair and equitable terms of use that protects Pinterests but acknowledges the commercial aspirations of developers</li>
<li><strong>Events / Meetups</strong> - Establish a roadshow or network of meetups that brings developers together and makes them part of the Pinterest API community</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few of the ways Pinterest could establish a solid business strategy for their API that would not only protect developer interests, it would establish the Pinterest API as an external research &amp; development department, with a built in incubation component.</p>
<p>Pinterest has already missed out on a year of developers innovating on their platform.  Why continue holding back innovation?  Establish a flexible API business strategy that allows for you to learn from the mistakes made by Twitter, and become the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/pinterests-api-is-coming-soon-and-vcs-are-super-excited-2012-2">platform VC&rsquo;s are looking for you to become</a>.</p>
