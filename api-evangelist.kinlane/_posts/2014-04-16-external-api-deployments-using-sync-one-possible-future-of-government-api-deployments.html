<p>I just wrote up a piece about how to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/15/api-driven-backend-for-apps-using-orchestrateio/">deploy an API driven application backend using Orchestrate.io,</a> and wrote a piece last week on <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/14/liberate-government-data-by-deploying-web-apis-with-solr/">API deployment using Solr and government data</a>. After writing about both of these approaches, I can't shake the thought that external, API driven approaches like this will become commonplace in the next couple of years.</p>
<p>Both the approach using Solr, and the other using Orchestrate.io, identify that data is available via a machine readable data dump and even an API, but neither solution provide the simple web API access that would make application development easy.</p>
<p>In both these stroies, 18F and Orchestrate.io are both looking to just get the job done, achieving their development goals--in one case deploy an API of federal business opportunities, and the other is to build a web application that will make browsing super hero characters easier.</p>
<p>Granted these two scenarios have radically different outcomes, but both share a common approach to meeting their goals:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/15/api-driven-backend-for-apps-using-orchestrateio/">Orchestrate.io</a></strong> - Uses Orchestrate.io to extract, store and normalize data from the Marvel API, making it much more accessible, searchable and usable in their MarvelousDB web application</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/08/18f-shows-what-is-possible-in-government-with-fbopen-api/">FBOpen</a></strong> - Uses Solr to mount and index business opportunities with the federal government in an XML dump, then deliver a web API so they can build the web interface for FBOpen, but also provide an open source API that anyone can use as is, or deploy on their own infrastructure</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these approaches are all about making the data and content they need for web and mobile apps, easily accessible via a simple API. Both of these projects acknowledge the data source they have to work with doesn&rsquo;t meet their exact requirements, but for very different reasons. One project uses open source software to tackle their problems, while the other uses the latest cloud services to provide a solution&mdash;both get the job done.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there will be one formula for this type of development that will work in all scenarios, but I think the pattern of extracting the data you need via a data dump or an API, and deploying an external API stack, independent of where you get the data, will be a pattern that can be re-used. This is especially ture in our federal government, where I think much of the innovation needs to occur adjacent to the agency who produces and manages valuable data and content resources, estlabishing API driven, public / private sector partnerships.</p>
<p>I envision a healthier API ecosystem where the government, and the private sector both encourage the re-purposing, and wholesale distribution of content and data, opening up a much more federated approach to delivering the resources we need to build both public, and private sector web and mobile applications.</p>
