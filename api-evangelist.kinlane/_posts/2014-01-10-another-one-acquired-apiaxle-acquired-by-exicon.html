<p>I got a email today letting me know that <a href="http://apiaxle.com/docs/acquisition-statement/">cloud platform Exicon, purchase API management provider ApiAxle</a>, further whittling away at all of the original and second wave of API management providers I&rsquo;ve been tracking on over the last 4 years.</p>
<p>ApiAxle first showed up as a blip on my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/15/roundup-of-20-api-service-providers-in-2012/">2012 API management provider roundup</a> when:</p>
<blockquote><em>ApiAxle started out as a side project when Phil Jackson was CTO at Qwerly and found their API management provider didn't quite fit the needs of a busy, commercial API. API growth had already exploded back then and so, in the same way you could pick from a plethora of databases or webservers, there seemed an obvious space for an open source API management platform. That's when ApiAxle was born.</em></blockquote>
<p>According to Phil Jackson, the ApiAxle brand will continue to live as part of the Exicon suite of products, and he will keep evolving his baby. While it is 2014 now, I would consider this acquisition the last of a string of API management acquisitions we saw in 2014 which included Layer7, Mashery, and Apiphany.</p>
<p>These leaves just a handful of API management providers on the acquisition table in 2014, including 3Scale, Apigee, Mashape and Apiary.io. Who is next? Will API management platforms be as hot of a commodity in 2014?</p>
