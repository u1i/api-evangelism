<p>I conducted two workshops this week in partnership with Intel at the Gartner AADI Conference in Las Vegas.  Working from my <a href="/the_building_blocks_of_a_successful_api.php">Building Blocks of a Successful API</a> material, I put together a 30 minute workshop that I conducted at 12 and 6PM on Tuesday.</p>
<p>My workshop started with the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/blog/tag.php?Search_Tag=History">history of APIs</a>, then walked through <a href="http://apievangelist.com/buildingblocks/">API building blocks</a> in 3 areas:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>API Design&nbsp;</li>
<li>API Development&nbsp;</li>
<li>API Evangelist</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I stepped back and emphasized that APIs are all about research &amp; development and business development for your company.</p>
<p>After stepping back, I looked into whats next with APIs with API aggregators like <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a>, API automation platforms like <a href="http://ifttt.com">IFTT</a> and new API programming libraries like <a href="http://webshell.io">Webshell</a>.</p>
<p>The goal of my talk was to plant a few seeds in attendee&rsquo;s mind:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>APIs Are More Than Tech&nbsp;</li>
<li>APIs Require a Business Approach&nbsp;</li>
<li>Politics Can Be Biggest Killer of APIs&nbsp;</li>
<li>Focus Delivering Value</li>
</ul>
<p>You can view the slide deck below for the workshop.  If you&rsquo;d like a custom demo feel free to contact me and we can do a Google Hangout.</p>
