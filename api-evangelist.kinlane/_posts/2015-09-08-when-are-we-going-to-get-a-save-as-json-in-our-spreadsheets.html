<p>My last rant of the evening, I promise. Then I will shut up and move back to actual work instead of telling stories. I'm working on my <a href="http://adopta.agency">Adopta.Agency</a> project, processing&nbsp;<a href="http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/geographic-distribution-of-va-expenditures-fy2013">a pretty robust spreadsheet of Department of Veterans Affairs expenditures by state</a>. As I'm working to convert yet another spreadsheet to CSV, and then to JSON, and publish to Github, I can't help but think, "where is the save as JSON" in Microsoft or Google Spreadsheets?</p>
<p>I can easily write scripts to help me do this, but I'm trying to keep the process as close to what the average person, who will be adopting a government agency data set, will experience. I could build a tool that they could also use, but I really want to keep the tools required for the work as minimal as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would just be easier if Microsoft and Google would get with the program, and give us a built in feature for saving our spreadsheets as JSON.</p>
