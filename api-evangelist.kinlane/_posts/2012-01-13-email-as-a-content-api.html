<p>I think email is highly underrated as a content API.  I know its not what we traditionally think of as an API, but has a lot of potential as a basic interface into an application.</p>
<p>An example of this is <a title="If This Then That" href="http://ifttt.com/">If This Then That (iftt)</a>. I use iftt to syndicate content to some of my blog platforms.  As part of my blogging strategy I want posts I publish on API Evangelist, to also show up on my <a title="Blogger" href="http://kinlane.blogspot.com/">Blogger</a>, <a title="Posterous" href="http://kinlane.posterous.com/">Posterous</a>, <a title="Tumblr" href="http://kinlane.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> and <a title="Wordpress" href="http://kinlane.posterous.com/">Wordpress</a>.</p>
<p>Using iftt you can setup tasks that get triggered on certain events.  One such trigger is a new post to an RSS feed.  So when a new blog posts shows up in the <a title="API Evangelist RSS Feed" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/ApiEvangelist">API Evangelist RSS</a> feed I can have iftt pull the title and body and push to a channel.  iftt provides channels for Posterous and Tumblr, allowing me to automatically syndicate using their APIs. &nbsp;</p>

<p>There are no channels for Blogger and Wordpress, so I use their Gmail channel in conjunction with the post by email features on Blogger and Wordpress.  So instead of using an API to syndicate my content, I use email as an interface for these blogging platforms.</p>
<p>Using email as a content API is obviously not for every situation, but for some application processes, it might just work for moving content from one application to another, without much overhead.</p>
