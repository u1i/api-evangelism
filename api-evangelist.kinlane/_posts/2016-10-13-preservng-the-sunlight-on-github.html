<p>I'm following along as the Sunlight Foundation winds down their operations and gathering any lessons along the way, that can help&nbsp;us open data and transparency folks can learn from as we do our work. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/23/learning-from-the-sunlight-foundation-situation-and-baking-transparency-into-projects/">I wrote earlier that we should be learning from the Sunlight Foundation situation and that we are making sure we bake transparency into our projects</a>&nbsp;and wanted to continue to extract wisdom we can reuse as they turn out the lights.</p>
<p>The Sunlight Foundation <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2016/10/04/github-and-internet-archive-helping-to-preserve-the-sunlight/">shared that they are working with the Internet Archive and Github to preserve their projects</a>, and that they are "trying to ensure the open source community can understand and use our projects in the future" by:</p>
<ul>
<li>adding documentation</li>
<li>standardizing licenses&nbsp;</li>
<li>scrubbing sensitive info</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the benefits of being transparent and open by default is that you tend&nbsp;to do all of this in real-time. If you are in the business of opening up data, making it accessible with open APIs, you should be using Github, documenting, and telling the story as you go along. Then you do not have to do it all when you are walking away--everything is open by default.</p>
<p>This is why I work out in the open on Github each day, it allows people to take my tools like <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/csv-converter">the CSV Converter</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/api-stack/api-stack">the API Stack</a>, and put them to work, even as I'm still evolving them. When I step away from a project, it can continue to live on with all the code, definitions, schema, data, licensing, and the story behind in a nice forkable package--no extra work necessary.</p>
<p>Anyways, just a couple of nuggets to consider as we are working on open data and API project across the space.</p>
