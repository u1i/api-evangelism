<p>The organizers of <a href="http://apidays.io/">APIs Days</a> asked me at the last moment if I'd like to do a third talk at the European API event, due to last minute cancellations. &nbsp;Of course, I jumped on the opportunity to generate to material and work through it in front of a live audience. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The talk was on <a href="/admin/blog/Business Models For Your API as a Start-Up" target="_blank">business models for your API as a start-up</a>. &nbsp;On the plane ride over I reviewed <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jmusser/j-musser-apishotnotgluecon2012" target="_blank">John Musser's great material on API business models</a>, and prepared a walk through, from a startup's perspective. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Then after watching Guillaume Ballas (<a href="https://twitter.com/guillaumebalas">@guillaumebalas</a>) from 3Scale give his talk&nbsp;<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/3scale/apis-for-biz-dev-20-which-business-model-15473323" target="_blank">APIs for Biz Dev 2.0, Which Business Model?</a> &nbsp;And watching other speakers I decide to scrap what I had put together, and went an entirely different direction.</p>
<p>I decide to walk through the evolution of an imaginary startup, keeping in mind 3Scale's philosphy that:</p>

<p>Let's not ask what business model for my API.You should be deploying an API for your business model. @<a href="https://twitter.com/3scale">3scale</a> @<a href="https://twitter.com/guillaumebalas">guillaumebalas</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23apidays">#apidays</a></p>

<p>Then I walked through what I would consider a robust, healthy startup business model with five tiers:</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/15473323" width="342" height="291" align="right"> </iframe></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Free users</li>
<li>Paid users</li>
<li>Free developers</li>
<li>Paid developers</li>
<li>Partners</li>
<li>Incubation</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, this approach isn't for every startup. &nbsp;I highly recommend checking out 3Scale's presentation if you want to better understand <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/3scale/apis-for-biz-dev-20-which-business-model-15473323">which API business model is right for your startup</a>.</p>
<p>I wanted to tell the story of how you could apply some or all of the monetization strategies outlined by John Musser in his work, while also listening to Guillaume from <a title="3Scale" href="http://www.3scale.net">3Scale</a>.</p>
<p>The talk is rooted in my research on the <a title="Business of Twitter's API" href="http://twitter.apivoice.com/">Business of Twitter's API</a> and experience I've had in the field consulting and building strategies with existing API owners.</p>
<p>You can view the presentation of my <a title="Business Models For Your API as a Start-Up" href="/talks/apidays/business-models/" target="_blank">Business Models For Your API as a Start-Up</a>, and I believe the session was video taped so I'm sure there will be video coming soon.</p>
