<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/app-showcase/Appstores.png" alt="" align="right" />The goal of any API evangelist is to encourage its community to build mobile and web applications around their API.
<p></p>When you and your community have several web apps, mobile apps, plugins or other tools you are proud of, showcase them.
<p></p>Whether you call it a showcase, directory, gallery or store...having an area that highlights the applications built upon your API is critical to continued API adoption and success.
<p></p>Application showcases do several things:<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/app-showcase/SimpleGeo-app-showcase.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Show developers love by showcasing their work and giving them the exposure the need
     </li>
     <li>Emphasize the work of your partners and the value they add to your platform
     </li>
     <li>Highlight the best apps your company has developed internally
     </li>
     <li>Show, not only do people use your API, they have delivered actual applications
     </li>
     <li>Demonstrates your API is easy to use and has value
     </li>
</ul>There are two ways to deploy an app store for your API. 1) build it yourself or 2) use a private label App Store solution like <a title="appstores.com" href="http://www.appstores.com"></a><a title="AppStores.com" href="http://appstores.com/">AppStores.com</a>. I can speak from experience, your time is better spent evangelizing, and not building your own app store.
