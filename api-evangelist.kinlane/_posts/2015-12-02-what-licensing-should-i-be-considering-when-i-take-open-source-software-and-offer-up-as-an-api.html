<p>I've done this a couple of times now. I took&nbsp;<a href="http://phantomjs.org/">PhantomJS</a>, and created my Screenshot API, and used&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php">ImageMagick</a> to create my Image Manipulation API. These are two openly licensed software solutions, which I took, and am using as an API.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are my licensing considerations? If I keep my server side code licensed according to the specifications, am I fine? PhantomJS is licensed under BSD, and ImageMagick is Apache 2.0. Does the licensing extend itself to the commercial services I would potentially offer via an API interface? There are lots of questions to satisfy, before I move forward--I guess I am looking for a precedent.</p>
<p>I am evaluating at a number of openly licensed software solutions right now to deliver a variety of stops along the API life-cycle, ranging from design, to deployment, virtualization, and much more. As always, I am trying to better understand the layers involved, and how software licenses, patent, and potentially copyright might apply.</p>
<p>Just putting it out there to the universe, and curious to see what comes back.</p>
