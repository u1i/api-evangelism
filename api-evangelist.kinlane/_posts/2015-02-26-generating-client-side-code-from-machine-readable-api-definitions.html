<p>This post has been open for almost two weeks now in Evernote. It began as a simple story about the possibility for generating code samples and libraries using Swagger. The longer it stays open, the wider the definition becomes, so I have to post something, just to draw a line in the sand. I&rsquo;m not talking about generating code that runs on the server, this post is all about everything on the API consumption side of things.</p>
<p>Shortly after Wordnik launched the machine readable API definition format&nbsp;<a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>, they launched a <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen">library for generating client side code samples in a variety of languages</a>. This was something that was evolved upon by <a href="http://bit.ly/1pb4H8k">Apiary</a>, with the launch of their API design platform, and introduction of <a href="http://bit.ly/1arUHCU">API Blueprint</a>. Even with these advances forward, there were still many shortcomings, and debate around what you could actually auto-generate on the client-side using a machine readable API definition continued. I can&rsquo;t tell you how many random Tweets I get from people saying, &ldquo;Oh is auto-generation of code cool again?&rdquo; or &ldquo;I thought you couldn&rsquo;t auto-generate client code or SDKs ;-)"</p>
<p>Amidst the debate about what is really possible, and the jokes about our SOA past, new players have emerged like <a href="http://bit.ly/1qnXcI0">Apimatic</a> that are looking to raise the bar when it comes to generation of not just simple code samples, libraries or stubs, but sophisticated API SDKs. I am sure the jokes about automating client code will still occurs, but there is no denying that the overall conversation is moving forward.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m exploring my own limitations of what is possible when generating client-side code with Swagger, I also come across new players like <a href="http://bit.ly/1DwAaXo">Lucybot</a>, who are <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/24/driving-your-single-page-applications-and-api-cookbooks-using-api-definition-formats-like-swagger-and-api-blueprint/">moving the conversation forward with API cookbooks, and Single Page App (SPA) generated from Swagger definitions</a>. I&rsquo;m not in denial that there is a lot of work ahead, but in the two weeks that I&rsquo;ve been crafting this post, I&rsquo;d say I have gotten a glimpse of what is next. When you bundle the latest movements in virtualization and containerization, and using API definitions like Swagger and API Blueprint to auto-generate client side code, I feel like the current potential is unlimited, and things are just heating up.</p>
