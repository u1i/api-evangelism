<p><a href="https://www.twilio.com/enterprise">While reviewing the details of Twilio's new enterprise plan</a>, the one thing that stood out for me was the strong emphasis of the security and legal elements within this level of business integration. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/05/security-will-increasingly-be-used-as-component-of-tiered-api-planning/">I've talked out security being included as part of plan details </a><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/05/security-will-increasingly-be-used-as-component-of-tiered-api-planning/">before</a>, and is something I will keep talking about as leading providers continue to bring it front and center as part of API plans and operations.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.twilio.com/enterprise">Advanced security is the focal point for Twilio's new enterprise plan</a>, providing audit events, and public key client validation, but shortly after showcasing these security features, the next section is all about providing finer grain access management including customizable role-based access control (RBAC), and Single Sing-On (SSO). Demonstrating how important security is overall to the average enterprise customer.</p>
<p>From what I'm seeing across API providers, security is definitely the number one concern, and something that I'm guessing will keep showing up as part of <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">API pricing and pricing tiers</a>. Every time I come across this practice in the wild I will record which elements are being included, and try to do a write up showcasing and sharing the approach. Good security practices and features won't be cheap, and as more companies tightene&nbsp;their belts, I am guessing it will keep bubbling up as paid features in the upper tiers of API access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the same note, the second area of growth I'm seeing, which is also present in TWilio's approach to their enterprise plan, is greater control over accounts, billing, and systems usage--something that includes API access, allowing API consumers to automate. Security is top of mind, but efficiently&nbsp;managing usage&nbsp;and dialing in revenue seems to be just as important to businesses looking looking to optimize their integrations with 3rd party API resources.</p>
