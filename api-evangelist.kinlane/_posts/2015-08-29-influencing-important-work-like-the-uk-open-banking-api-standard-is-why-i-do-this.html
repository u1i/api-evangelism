<p>I enjoy what I do, but when I embarked on my API Evangelist journey in 2010, I set myself on a mission to educate people about the business of APIs, and highlight that it isn't just the technology that makes APIs a thing. I have worked hard to distill down what it takes to execute an effective API management strategy into usable advice that anyone can run with when crafting an API strategy.</p>
<p>As I conduct my monitoring of the API space, It makes me feel accomplished, when I find my work cited, influencing important API related projects. This just occurred to me as I was taking a fresh look at&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-sharing-and-open-data-for-banks">Data	Sharing	and	Open	Data	for	Banks</a>, published by&nbsp;the HM	Treasury	and	Cabinet	Office&nbsp;in the United Kingdom. As I was reviewing the document I happened to search for apievangelist (I know, I'm vain)--I was pleased to find a single citation to my work.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Reference 152 -&nbsp;</strong>Thirdly, making the most	out	of	external	APIs	involves	providing	on-going	support	to	the	developers	and	third	party	organisations	that	make	use	of	them.	Good	API management	can	involve	providing	samples	of	code,	a	curated	support	forum,	a	sandpit	with	dummy	data,	an	up	to	date	blog,	FAQs	and	more.</p>
<p>It isn't much, but it is a nod to my work, that helps validate what I've been studying for the last five years--the business of APIs. For me, this isn't about recognition, its about knowing I'm making an impact, and I'm influencing policy, and helping companies, institutions, and government agencies understand API best practices. Little mission accomplished, I'm contributing a small piece to potentially improving the UK banking system, which is something that will undoubtedly spread beyond just England.</p>
<p>Ok, celebration is over. Nice job Kin. Back to work. There is too much to be done.</p>
