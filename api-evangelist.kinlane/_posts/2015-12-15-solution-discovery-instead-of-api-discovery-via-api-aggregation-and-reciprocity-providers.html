<p>During my API discovery session talk at <a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/">@APIStrat Austin this last November</a>, I talked about what I see as an added dimension to the concept of API discovery, one that will become increasingly important when it comes to actually moving things forward --- discovering solutions that are API driven vs. API discovery, where a developer is looking for an API.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It might not seem that significant to developers, but SaaS services like <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a>, <a href="http://apis.how/om0bbjpmec">DataFire</a>, and <a href="http://cloud-elements.com">API hubs like Cloud Elements</a>, bring this critical new dimension to how people actually will find your APIs. As nice as ProgrammableWeb has been for the last 10 years, we have to get more sophisticated about how we get our APIs in front of would-be consumers. We just can't depend on everyone who will put our API to work, immediately thinking that they need an API--most likely they are just going to need a solution to their problem, and secondarily need to understand there is an API driving things behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Of of many examples of this in the wild, could be in the area of tech support for your operations. Maybe you use Jira currently, because this is what your development team uses, but with a latest release you need something a little more public facing. When you are exploring what is possible with API reciprocity services like Zapier, and API hubs like Cloud Elements, you get introduced to other API driven solutions like Zendesk, or Desk.com from SalesForce.</p>
<p>This is just one example of how APIs can make an impact on the average business user, and will be the way API discovery happens in the future. In this scenario, I didn't set out looking for an API, but because I use API enabled service providers, I am introduced to other alternative solutions that might also help me tackle the problem I need. I may never have even known SalesForce had a help desk solution, if I wasn't already exploring the solutions Cloud Elements brings to the table.</p>
<p>As an API provider, you need to make sure your APIs are available via the growing number of <a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com/companies.html">API aggregation</a> and <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/companies.html">reciprocity providers</a>, and make sure the solutions they bring to the table are easily discoverable. You need to think beyond the classic developer focused version of <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery</a>, and make sure and think about API driven solution discovery meant for the average business or individual user.</p>
