<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/JSON.gif" alt="" align="right" /><a href="http://www.json.org/" target="_blank">JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)</a> is a way for programs to exchange information.  It is very similar to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML" target="_blank">XML (Extensible Markup Language)</a>.</p>
<p>APIs are are way for programs to communicate and since they don't have voices, they need a way to describe things.  APIs use JSON to describe information.</p>
<p>A JSON transmission describing me might look like:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/817134.js?file=API%20-%20Tech%20-%20JSON"></script>
<p>JSON uses brackets, quotes, colons and commas to separate data, and give the information meaningful structure.  It allows computers to tell the difference between my first name and last name or any other information that describes me.  The protocol sketched above is really just an approximation of what JSON does.  After all, it is meant for computers and not humans,</p>
<p>JSON has become one of the preferred methods for programmers to use for API communication.  It's a light weight, simple way to exchange data across the Internet while still maintaining the structure and meaning of that data.</p>
