<h2>Contact API Evangelist</h2>
<p>Please contact me with any specific questions through then channels below, but with each channel I would also like to offer you some advice to help you make sure your messages are received, and get the response you are looking for.</p>
<section>
  <div class="features">
    {% assign contactinfo = site.data.contactinfo.index | sort: 'view_sort' %}
    {% for info in contactinfo %}
        <article>
          <p><a href="{{ info.url }}" target="_blank"><img src="{{ info.image }}" width="150" style="padding: 15px;" align="center" /></a></p>
          <div class="content">
            <h3><a href="{{ info.url }}" target="_blank">{{ info.name }}</a></h3>
            <p>{{ info.description }}</p>
          </div>
        </article>
    {% endfor %}
  </div>
</section>
<p>As a one person operation, I do my best to keep up with the channels listed above, but there are some weeks where I'm focused on research, coding, and writing, and may not always be available.</p>
<p>I appreciate your interest, and looking forward to talking more about APIs.</p>
