<h2>API Evangelist Services</h2>
<p>These are just a few  of the services I offer to my clients as part of my work as the API Evangelist. These service are developed over the last seven years operating in the API space and working with a variety of companies doing APIs in a specific industry, as well as selling services to the API sector.</p>
<p>If you need help with any stop along the 70+ areas of the API lifecycle I track on, let me know how I can help. I'm a one person shop, but I depend on about 50% of my time spent on consulting to pay the bills, as well as procure a steady stream of stories, and real life best practices when it comes to APIs.</p>

<p>These are the common areas I work with companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies when it comes to APIs. Over the last seven years I've developed a unique set of skills that have helped people better understand the API sector, and how it applies to their specific organizational or even individual goals.</p>
<p>Let me know how I can help you, I'm open to discussions about how I can help you better understand and play an active role in the API sector. I work with many organizations in a one time engagement, as well as have regular conversations with a variety of API providers, and service provides in the space.
