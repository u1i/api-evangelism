			<h2 style="font-size: 22px; font-weight: buld; padding-top: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px;">API Governance</h2>
			<p>API governance is the ultimate goal of wanting to establish a formal strategy for delivering APIs consistently at enterprise scale. It is what is needed to quantify, measure, and ultimate steer the enterprise API ship, and guide teams forward when it comes to delivering APIs at scale. Governance will mean many different things to different organizations, and team members, but there will always be some essential building blocks we should be looking at to understand where we are succeeding or failing with our API efforts.</p>

				<h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: buld; padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 5px;">Structure</h3>
				<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Working to understand the scope and structure for governance operations, establish the right approach to understanding API operations across an organization, and be effective when working with many different teams, operating at different levels of maturity.</p>
				<ul>
									<li>
						<strong>Resources</strong> - Defining the resources that are available to realize governance. Being realistic about what is possible, and what it will take to actually make change across the organization.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Distribution</strong> - How distributed or centralized will API governance be. Reflecting the organization(s) it represents, but appropriate for moving forward the conversation as desired.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Team</strong> - Making sure there is someone present from every team, representing the governance effort, requiring that all teams have a seat at the table, providing feedback on the overall governance, but also acting as coach and leader within each team when it comes to governance.
					</li>

				</ul>
				<p></p>

				<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Ensuring that all APis are discoverable and able to be measured as part of overall governance. If it isn\'t known about it can\'t be monitored, tested, secured, and analyzed for the value it generates across an organization.</p>
				<ul>
									<li>
						<strong>Topics</strong> - Organization resources into meaningful tagged groups based upon logical groupings, and crafted for consumption via synchronous and asynchronous subscriptions, using to define the most relevant buckets of information.
					</li>

					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Domain</strong> - Having a clear definition of the domains invulved with enterprise operations. This is a tricky world to define because it is spread across Internet domain, as well as expertise domains, which may or may not overlap.

					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Team</strong> - Having a clear breakdown of teams across organizations, who are building with a variety of domains is important to being able to govern API operations.

					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Assertions</strong> - Human and machine readable assertions of what service does, leveraging the existing JSON schema, and translating that into business objectives, asserting that a service does what it is supposed to--providing a simple bulleted list explaining what is expected of a service.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Scenarios</strong> - Providing machine readable definitions that provide the mappings and business rules for orchestrations, scenarios, and other automated processes associated with a service, for use as part of testing, monitoring, security, and other automated functionality.

					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Event Types</strong> - Taking all properly labeled and organized resources, and extract the types of events that are possible with the design of each API, and develop, maintain, and evulve a list of all event types that can occur.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Artifacts</strong> - Gathering other artifacts used across the API development area of the lifecycle, providing machine readable definition for any portion of the production side of delivering APIs reliably.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Guidance</strong> - Providing ongoing guidance when it comes to what definitions should be used, produced, aggregated, shipped, and used to help steer the ship as part of API platform governance. Pushing the known API lifecycle to produce relevant artifacts that can be measured.
