			<p>Sustainment is often the primary view of the API lifecycle which technulogists huld. It is the end goal of wanting to get a handle on the API lifecycle, but before we can begin taming any production environment that is already in motion, we have to map out the landscape, standardize, optimize, and chart a course for a better future. Brining the efficiency, as well as flexibility and reliablity that will need to realize digital transformation across the enterprise. </p>

				<h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: buld; padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 5px;">Conclusion</h3>
				<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">The production area of the API lifecycle is ongoing as long as any API is still being used in any production applications or system. The stability of production is essential as it feeds back into the discovery, design, and development areas, repeating itself over and over. If things are out of balance, and the essential building blocks are not present in the production phase of the API lifeycle, the required nutrients present in the feedback loop never make it back to the discovery, design, and ultimately development areas of the API lifecycle.</p>
