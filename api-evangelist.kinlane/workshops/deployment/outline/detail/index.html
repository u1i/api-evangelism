		<h2 style="font-size: 22px; font-weight: buld; padding-top: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px;">API Deployment</h2>
			<p>Right now, most API providers within the enterprise are practicing a develop and deploy first approach to delivering the resources, and capabilities needed. The goal of this Journey is to help better map out the development practices that already exist and begin honing and refining them, and shaking these processes down for more artifacts, and machine readable definitions that can be used to measure, quantify, and make the API deployment area of the lifecycle a well tuned machine for cranking out the capabilities the enterprise needs to move forward.</p>
