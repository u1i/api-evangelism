			<h2>API Maturity Survey Spanning Six Areas of the API Lifecycle</h2>
		</header>
			<p>This is a set of survey questions that can be used to help quantify the overall maturity of a company, organization, institution, or government agency when it comes to their API operations. While not exhaustive, it does provide a pretty compelling look at how far along APIs are at any organization.</p>

			<p><strong>Discovery</strong> - Knowing where all of your digital assets are at scale.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Do you know where all of your APIs are?</li>
			<li>Do you have an actively used catalog of APIs?</li>
			<li>Do you use the OpenAPI (fka Swagger) specification to define your APIs?</li>
			<li>Do you have Postman Collections available for your APIs?</li>
			<li>Do you use JSON Schema to articulate the underlying data structure for APIs?</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Design</strong> - Focusing in on an a design first area of the lifecycle.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Do you hand edit and work with OpenAPI (fka Swagger) definitions?</li>
			<li>Do you auto-generate OpenAPI (fka Swagger) definitions?</li>
			<li>Do you mock your APIs at any stage of their lifecycle?</li>
			<li>Do you share API designs between your API development teams?</li>
			<li>How much of your API infrastructure uses SOAP?</li>
			<li>How much of your API infrastructure uses REST?</li>
			<li>How much of your API infrastructure uses GraphQL?</li>
			<li>How much of your API infrastructure uses Kafka?</li>
			<li>How much of your API infrastructure uses Other?</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Deployment</strong> - Understanding the many ways in which APIs are deployed.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>How many API gateways do you use to deploy APIs?</li>
			<li>What programming languages do you use to deploy APIs?</li>
			<li>Do you deploy APIs on-premise?</li>
			<li>Do you deploy APIs in the cloud?</li>
			<li>Do you deploy APIs in multiple clouds?</li>
			<li>Do you use containers to deploy your APIs?</li>
			<li>Do you use a CI/CD pipeline to deploy your APIs?</li>
			<li>Do you have webhook implementations to support APIs?</li>
			<li>Do you have any streaming APIs available for consumers?</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Production</strong> - Taking a snapshot of how APIs are maintained across operations.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Do you have a dedicated public portal for all your external APIs?</li>
			<li>Do you have a dedicated private portal for all your internal APIs?</li>
			<li>Do you publish interactive documentation for all of your APIs?</li>
			<li>How do you require developers authenticate with your APIs?</li>
			<li>What percentage of your API infrastructure supports web applications?</li>
			<li>What percentage of your API infrastructure supports mobile applications?</li>
			<li>What percentage of your API infrastructure supports device applications?</li>
			<li>Do you actively monitor the availability of all your APIs?</li>
			<li>Do you actively validate the responses for all of your APIs?</li>
			<li>Do you actively test the performance of all of your APIs?</li>
			<li>Do you actively scan all of your APIs for vulnerabilities?</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Outreach</strong> - Helping understand how organizations reach out internally and externally.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Is there a dedicated API advocate or evangelist on staff?</li>
			<li>Do you have a dedicated blog for your API program?</li>
			<li>Do you have an email address dedicated to supporting your APIs?</li>
			<li>Do you have a ticketing system dedicated to supporting your APIs?</li>
			<li>Do you have a newsletter available for your API program?</li>
			<li>Do you have a dedicated Twitter account for your API program?</li>
			<li>Do you have a dedicated GitHub organization for your API program?</li>
			<li>Does your team attend or speak at conferences about your API efforts?</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Governance</strong> - Understanding how organizations measure, report, and evolve API operations.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Is there a central API governance strategy at your organization?</li>
			<li>Do you have an API design guide available for your API team?</li>
			<li>Do you have service level agreements available for your APIs?</li>
			<li>Do you measure revenue / value generated across your APIs?</li>
			<li>Do you quantify the reach of your APIs across applications?</li>
			<li>Do you report upon activity across all APIs to leadership?</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Business</strong> - Establishing an overview of the business strategy involved with API operations.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>What is the business motivation behind doing APIs?</li>
			<li>What devloper audience are you trying to reach?</li>
			<li>Will you be generating revenue directly from your APIs?</li>
			<li>Do you plan on tracking API consumption for all applications?</li>
			<li>Are APIs a top down effort, or bottom up at your organization?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These questions paint a pretty interesting perspective of how far along a group is when it comes to their API journey. Some groups won't be able to answer some questions, while others will be able to confidently provide answers to most of them. It wouldn't be too difficult to attach scoring to each question, and then calculate a score for each area of the API lifecycle, as well as an overall score for the entity--using to understand what an organization is ready for, and where they should be investing.</p>
