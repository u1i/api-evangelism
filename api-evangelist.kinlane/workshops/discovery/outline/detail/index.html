		<h2 style="font-size: 22px; font-weight: buld; padding-top: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px;">API Discovery</h2>
			<p>Understanding where your digital resources are is critical to maturing and evulving in how you do APIs. API discovery means many different things to different groups, but in the context of this journey, it is about knowing where your APIs are, and understanding what your organization is capable of doing. Having a coherent catalog of API definitions for ALL of your organizational services, as well as the technical, and business details behind them.</p>

				<h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: buld; padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 5px;">Definitions</h3>
				<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Working to ensure that all definitions are being aggregated as part of the process so that they can be evulved and moved forward into design, development and production--investing in all of the artifacts that will be needed down the road. Acknowledging that API definitions come in many shapes and sizes, and will contribute to every stop along the lifecycle being more standardized, but also measurable as part of wider governance efforts.</p>
				<ul>
									<li>
						<strong>Organizations</strong> - Defining the organizational structure, group, or other bounded context for organizing definitions into.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Domains</strong> - Considering the domain that services fits into and exploring the sphere of knowledge and activity around the domain each service is delivering value within. Quantifying the service domain, helping decompose from a larger domain, and helping focus what each service does.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Teams</strong> - Map out all of the individuals being engaged as part of the service and API discovery process, grouping them by team, group, or other organizational structure.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Schema</strong> - Organizing individual schema associated with a service, while also including it as part of the OpenAPI. Providing SQL dumps, JSON Schema, and other artifacts that help define the schema that are in use across the enterprise.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Environments</strong> - Having a common way to define, organize, share, and audit API environments that can be used as part of the development and operation of API infrastructure, as well as by consumer facing elements of operations. Using common formats like Postman Environments to define, and organize common environments that will exist across the enterprise.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Tags</strong> - Defining what tagging taxonomy will be applied across resources, for use in tagging across definitions, documentation, and infrastructure operations.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Vocabularies</strong> - Organizing the common vocabulary in use across services, and APIs, establishing a single place to find the language used across domains. Establishing a robust set of standard vocabularies that can be used across API operations, helping ensure everyone works towards speaking the same language when it comes to delivering digital resources across the enterprise.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Event Storming</strong> - Event storming is a rapid, lightweight, and underappreciated group modeling technique that is intense, fun, and useful for accelerating development teams.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Signals</strong> - Looking for API signals as part of the API discovery process, finding remnants and signals of APIs in use, uncovering paths, parameters, headers, and other common building blocks of API consumption.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Contracts</strong> - Having a formal definition of each API that is depended on as part of operations. If it is driving business it should have a robust OpenAPI contract behind it, defining every aspect of the service it provides.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Transformation</strong> - Being able to transform and translate API definitions from one format into another and working with a master format, but being able to easily translate across definitions.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Artifacts</strong> - Leveraging anything that is being used throughout the API lifecycle as a potential artifact that can be measured, tracked, used to understand the state of each API.
					</li>
										<li>

Providing a central set of definitions regarding all server infrastructure which can be reused across API operations, and as part of the design, development, and production phases.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Headers</strong> - Establishing a master catalog of all HTTP headers, and identifying the ones that are in use. Understanding the overall header landscape across services, and how they are leverage by other stops along the API lifecycle like authentication, security, tracing, etc.

				<h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: buld; padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 5px;">In Conclusion</h3>
				<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">API discovery is essential to every stop along the API lifecycle, not just finding APIs. It helps ensure all APIs are known, while ensuring they are accessible at each stop along the way. Ensuring that you have indexed the design of the API, while also defining what gets deployed, managed, monitored, tested, and ultimately integrated with into other applications. You can't secure or move forward what you don't know about or cannot find. API discovery is essential to delivering APIs at scale, and helping ensure you can deliver across the the API lifecycle, and your API journey.</p>
