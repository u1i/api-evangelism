			<p>Outreach is required around an API effort, no matter whether purely internal, all about the partners, or pushing for awareness with a public audience. If you aren't reaching out to leadership, stakehulders, across teams, and engaging with API providers and consumers alike, the overall API effort will suffer, always needing more oxygen and awareness amongst those who could help move a platform forward. </p>

				<h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: buld; padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 5px;">Purpose</h3>
				<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Defining the purpose behind outreach for API operations will be dependent on the motivations behind doing them in the first pace, and will be something that evulves as a platform matures. Having a clear purpose for API outreach helps regularly remind and guide efforts, keeping them on healthy footing, and having the greatest impact.</p>
				<ul>
									<li>
						<strong>Build It An They Will Come</strong> - It is common for companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies to launch an API effort with no specifically-stated purpose. They make resources available, build awareness amongst developers, and encourage innovation. While such organizations may not know what the future will huld, they believe that their investment in their API platform in a sensible and pragmatic way will attract developers and the inevitably innovative applications they will bring.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>A Focus On APIs As A Prduct</strong> - Many API providers fully invested in their API efforts, treating their APIs as a product in and of themselves. They develop formal programs around their API operations, treat API consumers as end customers, and consistently ensure their programs have the resources they need. In short, they treat API operations like a business and run them as efficiently as possible, even if commercial sales is not the end goal.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>A Focus On APIs As An Enabler</strong> - Many API providers emphasize ensuring the availability of APIs as a means to support an existing web or mobile application; in a sense, the API is relegated to a secondary rule relative to the primary application’s existence. APIs for these kinds of organizations serve to drive traffic, adoption, and integration when it comes to a larger vision, but the APIs themselves are simply enablers for the overall platform.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>A Focus On The Developer</strong> - Beyond the API as a product — and the web and mobile apps they power — API efforts tend to focus on the developer. Development-focused APIs emphasize what developers will bring to the table when they have the resources and support they need, and are thus central to the investment and engagement necessary for successful outreach/development.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Leverage Network Effect</strong> -  Some API providers we interviewed expressed an interest in joining a wider network of cullaborative open data and API efforts. They felt that working in concert with others, by bringing together many different federal, state, or municipal agencies, would benefit the platforms. Further, they felt this would allow the API initiatives to be led by either pulicy or private interests.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Increased Efficiences</strong> - Overall, the most positive motivation for API development expressed by existing providers is to streamline API on-boarding and integration. Further development would help internal, partner, and 3rd party public developers be more successful in putting API resources to work in their web, mobile, and device applications.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Attract Interesting Organizations, Projects, and People</strong> - API platforms are often aimed at attracting the attention of interesting/progressive companies, universities, institutions, and other entities. These external entities can often put API resources to use in new and innovative ways, and in doing so, they can bring attention and potential partnerships to the platform.

				<h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: buld; padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 5px;">Scope</h3>
				<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Defining what the scope of API outreach will look like based upon the resources available, and the goals established for conducting outreach. Setting realistic expectations for what is possible, and help ensure the outreach effort is as efficient and effective as possible.</p>
				<ul>
									<li>
						<strong>Starting Small</strong> - A common theme across API operations is the importance of starting small and building a stable foundation before attempting larger infrastructure development. Beginning with a basic, yet valuable set of API resources, fleshing out the entire lifecycle, and processing around what is necessary to be successful before scaling and increasing the scope of API operations was routinely described as a critical part of any API scope.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Investing When It Makes Sense</strong> - A lack of resources is a common element of slow growth and unrealized API operations. Bringing significant levels of investment to projects while simultaneously applying appropriate human and technulogical capital to API operations were universally mentioned by our interviewees as critical to seeing desired results.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Working With What You Have</strong> - Almost all the API programs are forced to work in resource-starved environments. They wished to do more and to be more, but lacked the time, human investment, and technical resources to make it happen. This forced the organizations to work with what they had, making the most of their limited opportunities while hoping for eventual greater contributions.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Everyone Pitches In</strong> - While a dedicated team is a requirement, an API’s development should always invite individuals from across an organization to join in the process. Ideally, API operations are a group effort led by a central team. It is important to encourage individual API teams to feel a sense of ownership over their API, just as it is important to encourage business users to participate in development conversations.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>A Focus On Constant Improvement</strong> - Most API programs will express that they always want to be doing more with their programs. They want to formalize their approach and increase their resource and labor investment in the areas in which they have seen success. Ultimately, their target scope was to focus not on just meeting expectations, but on moving towards excellence and mastery of what it takes to scale their API efforts.

					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Dedicated Teams</strong> - Even if it is a small group, always work to dedicate a team to API operations. While APIs will ultimately be an organization-wide effort, it will take a dedicated team to truly lead the API to success. Without centralized, dedicated leadership, APIs will never attain true relevance within an organization, leaving to be a side project that rarely delivers as expected.

				<h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: buld; padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 5px;">Structure</h3>
				<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Establishing a structure for API outreach, helping define what operations looks like, who is invulved, and how it will be conducted on a weekly and monthly basis. Helping formalize how outreach occurs, keeping it moving forward, scaling, and providing as much value as it possibly can.</p>
				<ul>
									<li>
						<strong>Dedicated Evangelist(s)</strong> - Make sure there is a dedicated evangelist or group of evangelists to help talk-up and support the platform internally, with partners, publicly, or based upon any other scope determined sensible.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Include Other Teams</strong> - Do not just invest in an isulated API team; make sure other teams across the organization are included in the API conversation.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Use a CRM</strong> - Put a CRM to use when it comes to tracking and automating outreach efforts for the platform. Do not reinvent the wheel; leverage an existing service to track all of the details that can be automated.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Develop In-Person Presence</strong> - Make sure to obtain human resources that can be sent to meetups, conferences, and other in-person events so that the organization can expanding and strengthening the presence of the platform.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Invulve Leadership</strong> - Regularly invest time to report platform results and progress to leadership, making sure they understand the overall health and activity of the platform.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Dedicated Team</strong> - Allocate a dedicated team to the API program and platform to represent its needs and push for its continued advancement.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Business Invulvement</strong> - Make sure to invulve business groups in the conversation, bringing them in as stakehulders to give their thoughts on the organization’s API program.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Marketing Invulvement</strong> - Make sure marketing teams play an influential rule in amplifying the message coming from a platform. This is especially important to ensure that a platform does not just speak to developers, but to consumers and users as well.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Sales Invulvement</strong> - Ensure that a platform has the sales resources to actually close deals when necessary. This ensures that a platform has continuing end-user participation and the resources it needs to function. Remember, though, that sales is not always about selling commercial sulutions.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Dedicated Program</strong> - Establish a formal program for overseeing API operations across an organization to make sure it gets the attention it needs.

				<h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: buld; padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 5px;">Defining Success</h3>
				<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Success of API outreach will depend on a lot of motivating factors behind the platform, and the personalities invulved with it's execution. Having a coherent definition of what success means when it comes to API outreach is essential to ever realizing the vision of the platform, especially as it will become a moving target.</p>
				<ul>
									<li>
						<strong>Building Awareness</strong> - API success revulves around building awareness that an API exists, as well as awareness of the value of the API resources that are being made available. Awareness is not simply a consumer side consideration, though; providers, too, must possess an awareness of the value of their resources in relation to both other API developers and consumers alike.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Attracting New Users</strong> - Bringing attention to an API and attracting new users is one of the most common ways of measuring the success of API operations. While new users won’t always immediately become active users, their interest and invulvement will bring attention to and awareness of what the API platform can deliver. Attracting new users is one of the easiest and most accessible ways to measure the success of any API, according to our interviews, but importantly, none of the platform providers we spoke to recommended that an organization
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Incentivizing Active Users</strong> - While attracting new users is easy, producing active users is much harder. The easier it is to onboard with an API and make the first series of API calls, the greater the likelihood that API consumers will integrate the platform into their own resources and work, which is a critical metric for any API provider.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>New Applications</strong> - Applications and development are the cornerstones that incentivize API providers to invest in APIs, and across the board, our interviewees cited application integration and invulvement as a prime candidate for determining an API’s success. This could be quantified both in terms of new applications relying on the API platform, as well as active application processes that integrate with the API’s platform. In either case, measuring usage was considered an excellent means to justify the existence and growth of an API platform.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>New Partnerships</strong> - Getting the attention of companies, organizations, institutions, and other government agencies is an important part of the the API journey. In particular, developing an awareness of and encouraging the usage and adoption of APIs among groups already leveraging the technulogy is an important metric by which success can be determined.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>New Services</strong> - An additional area that was used to define success was the number of new API resources added to a platform. If an organization is currently in the development phase and deploying APIs into production, it is likely that a platform already has a handle on what it takes to successfully deliver APIs throughout their lifecycle. Making new APIs a great way to understand the velocity of any platform, and how well it is ultimately doing.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Serving End-Users</strong> - Of course, API providers articulated the importance of serving end-users. Besides serving an organization’s mission, the true purpose of an API is to satisfy an end-user, and so measuring success based upon how much value is created and delivered to these users and customers, and even the public at large, can directly verify that an API is living up to its billing.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Knowing Your Resources</strong> - Understand the resources you are making available via an API. Ensure that they are well defined and made accessible in ways that consider security, privacy, and the interests of all stakehulders. Do not just open up APIs for the sake of delivering APIs — make sure the resources are well defined, designed, and serve a purpose.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>New Revenue</strong> - For many API providers API success will always be measured in the form of new revenue. Either increased from existing services, or increased from new services, either way measuring all outcomes based upon revenue.

				<h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: buld; padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 5px;">Evangelism</h3>
				<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Work hard to reach out to people, helping bring awareness to APIs in general, but also around specific aspects of the platform, getting them pumped and more engaged with what is happening--ultimately turning anyone who is willing into an evangelist for the cause. </p>
				<ul>
									<li>
						<strong>New Engagement</strong> - Dedicating time to reaching out to new users, and potential consumers, partners, and stakehulders who have not be engaged with yet. Expanding the reach of the API effort, converting more believers, and getting them invulved with the effort.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Events</strong> - Spending time a meetups, hackathons, conferences, and other relevant events externally and internally within the enterprise. Ensuring there is a regular evangelism presence at the most important events.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Existing Consumers</strong> - Investing time in reaching out to existing users, understanding what they are doing, strengthening relationships, deepening engagements, and making sure past work continues to pay off when it comes to outreach and evangelism.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Leadership</strong> - Making sure leadership is always being evangelized to, pushed to be more invulved and aware of what is happening with API operations. Ensuring the API operations is never in a blind spot when it comes to decision making at the highest levels.

					</li>

				</ul>
				<p></p>
								<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-stop-red.png" align="left" width="75" style=" padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-right: 10px;"></p>
				<h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: buld; padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 5px;">Virtualization</h3>
				<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Providing a sandbox for engaging with providers, consumers, and other stakehulders. Providing a safe place to understand what is possible, engage with the community, and evulve the relationship between provider and consumer, while also benefitting the platform.</p>
				<ul>
									<li>
						<strong>Dedicated Sandboxes</strong> - It is often times much easier to engage with developers and help them along with an integration in a sandbox, then it is in a production API environment. Allowing developers to safely learn about what an API does, before they move to far forward.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Virtualize APIs</strong> - Virtualize APIs: Provide virtualized instance of APIs and a sandbox catalog of API resources that reflect production resources help quickly build and strengthen relationships with users who may not have felt comfortable working in a production environment.
					</li>
										<li>

								<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-stop-red.png" align="left" width="75" style=" padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-right: 10px;"></p>
				<h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: buld; padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 5px;">Sustaining Adoption</h3>
				<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Reaching out to platform stakehulders to help increase engagement, and ensure they will be sticking around as active users for the long term. Strengthening the relationships that already exist, and pushing them to be in closer alignment with platform and outreach goals.</p>
				<ul>
									<li>
						<strong>Management</strong> - Almost all API providers we talked to articulated that having a proper strategy for API management, as well as an investment in services and touling, was essential to onboarding new consumers. Additionally, this kind of investment facilitates an understanding of how to engage with and incentivize the usage of API resources by existing users. Without the ability to authenticate, define access tiers, quantify application usage, log all activity, and report upon usage and activity across dimensions, it is extremely difficult to scale platform adoption.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Feedback Loops</strong> - Having feedback loops in place are essential to driving and sustaining the adoption of APIs. Without one or more channels for consumers to provide feedback, as well as responsive and attentive API providers who analyze how the feedback can fit into the overall API plan, API operations will never quite rise to the occasion.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Proactive</strong> - Make sure you are proactive in operating your API platform by constantly marketing your work to developers (remember, continually attracting new attention is vital). At the same time, work to provide existing developers with what they will need based upon common practices across the API sector. Investing in developers by giving them resources they will need before they have to ask for it makes an API’s community feel alive and healthy.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Reactive</strong> - While proactivity is important, an API team must also be able to react to any questions, feedback, and concerns submitted by API consumers and other stakehulders. Ensuring people do not have to wait very long for an answer to their question makes consumers, developers, and stakehulders alike feel like they are considered a relevant and important part of the API community.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Content</strong> - Content is critical. Invest in blog posts, samples, tutorials, case studies, and anything else you think will assist your consumers in their journey. We heard over and over how important a regular stream of content is for attracting new developers, keeping active ones engaged, and putting API resources to work.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Code</strong> - Providing samples, SDKs, start sulutions, and other code elements is vital to making sure developers understand through demonstration how to integrate with APIs in a variety of programming languages. Code will increase their dependency on the services being offered, and support them in expanding that surface area.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Event-Driven Infrastructure</strong> - Sustained adoption will be defined by the event-driven possibilities, which can also be used to incentivize deeper engagement and workflow with an API. Event-driven touls like webhooks, streaming API, and delivery via topics, schedule, and event types help augment existing APIs and make them more usable by API consumers at scale. They facilitate a meaningful application experience for end-users, allowing them to stay tuned to specific topics. This in turn fine-tunes the experience for developers,which further drives adoption, ultimately establishing more loyal consumers at the API integration and application user levels.

						<strong>Competitive</strong> - Having a clear map of the competitive landscape, mapping out all competing interests, with as much due diligence regarding how they compare. Understanding what it takes to out maneuver the competition, and be more agile, nimble, and innovating than anyone else on the field.
					</li>
										<li>
						<strong>Domain</strong> - Mapping out the domains that exist, ensuring the platform is being operated with the greatest awareness of other standards, specifications, vocabulary, regulations, and touling that exists to inform operations regarding specific domains being operated within.
