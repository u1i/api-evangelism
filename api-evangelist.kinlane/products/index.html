<h2>API Evangelist Products</h2>
<p>I support my research in part by selling guides to the fast moving world of APIs. I try to keep my guides affordable, and updated regularly. Here is a list of the ones I currently have available.</p>
<p>I am slowly working to develop other products beyond just content. I have a variety of templates and toolkits I'd like to develop, as well as training, curriculum, and other video or audio content that compliments my regular short form and long form storytelling.</p>
<section id="banner">
  <div class="features">
    {% assign products = site.data.products.index | sort: 'view_sort' %}
    {% for product in products %}
        <article>
          <p><a href="{{ product.url }}" target="_blank"><img src="{{ product.image }}" width="150" style="padding: 15px;" align="center" /></a></p>
          <div class="content">
            <h3><a href="{{ product.url }}" target="_blank">{{ product.name }}</a></h3>
            <p>{{ product.description }}</p>
          </div>
        </article>
    {% endfor %}
  </div>
</section>
<p>I am working to update these regularly, and add new ones for other areas of my research as I can. While much of this content is available across my sites, each guide is an unique aggregation of my research, with additional analysis when I can.</p>
<p>If there is a specific area of my research you'd like to see a guide for, feel free to let me know. I'm happy to priotize a specific stop along the API lifecycle, as well as accept the underwriting of my research, writing, and curriculum development.</p>
<p>Thank you for your interest and support of my research - Kin Lane.</p>
