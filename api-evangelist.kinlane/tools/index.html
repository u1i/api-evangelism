<h2>API Evangelist Tools</h2>
<p>I am a programmer. I have over 30 years of experience programming. Even though I do not currently own any toolion environment, or technology tools, beyond operating my own infrastructure, I still can't help myselft when it comes to developing micro apps. I really enjoy developing simple, usually standalone JavaScript applications that run 100% on Github using Jekyll, and accomplish some specific goal in the API space.</p>
<p>While not all my tools are ready for prime time, I try to keep them each in their own Github Repo, with as much of the backstory, code, data, and other definitions needed to understand what is going on. When I feel a tool is relevant, or maybe publish a story about it, I will usually add it to this list of API Evangelist tools, and share as part of my regular research, and even sometimes to operate my business.</p>
<section id="banner">
  <div class="features">
    {% assign tools = site.data.tools.index | sort: 'view_sort' %}
    {% for tool in tools %}
        <article>
          <p><a href="{{ tool.url }}" target="_blank"><img src="{{ tool.image }}" width="150" style="padding: 15px;" align="center" /></a></p>
          <div class="content">
            <h3><a href="{{ tool.url }}" target="_blank">{{ tool.name }}</a></h3>
            <p>{{ tool.description }}</p>
          </div>
        </article>
    {% endfor %}
  </div>
</section>
<p>I am working to update these regularly, and add new ones for other areas of my research, and running API Evangelist when I can. While many of my tools are functional, and I actively use them in my work, you should check with me before ever puttting them into a production environment.</p>
<p>If there is a specific area you'd like to see a tool for, feel free to let me know. I'm happy to priotize a specific stop along the API lifecycle, as well as take on paid work to develop micro tooling, when it contributes to the API community.</p>
