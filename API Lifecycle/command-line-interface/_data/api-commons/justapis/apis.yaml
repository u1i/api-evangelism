description: "JustAPIs is designed to help developers overcome existing limitations
  when it comes to building APIs. The JustAPIs solution is a high-performance, compiled
  executable that can run on any Linux, Windows, or Mac OSX based hardware, from a
  single developer\u2019s laptop to large-scale, clustered production environments.
  With zero dependencies, JustAPIs can be installed instantly and includes sample
  APIs with familiar JavaScript-based business logic, so developers can be up and
  running with their own API server in minutes."
