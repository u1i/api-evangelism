    Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and
    run distributed applications. Consisting of Docker Engine, a portable,
    lightweight runtime and packaging tool, and Docker Hub, a cloud service for
    sharing applications and automating workflows, Docker enables apps to be
    quickly assembled from components and eliminates the friction between
    development, QA, and production environments. As a result, IT can ship
    faster and run the same app, unchanged, on laptops, data center VMs, and any
    cloud.
