  description: The Safe Browsing APIs (v4) let your client applications check URLs
    against Google's constantly updated lists of unsafe web resources. Examples of
    unsafe web resources are social engineering sites (phishing and deceptive sites)
    and sites that host malware or unwanted software. Any URL found on a Safe Browsing
    list is considered unsafe.

  description: When you visit a website, online trackers and the site itself may be
    able to identify you &ndash; even if you&rsquo;ve installed software to protect
    yourself. It&rsquo;s possible to configure your browser to thwart tracking, but
    many people don&rsquo;t know how. Panopticlick will analyze how well your browser
    and add-ons protect you against online tracking techniques. We&rsquo;ll also see
    if your system is uniquely configured&mdash;and thus identifiable&mdash;even if
    you are using privacy-protective software.

  description: Privacy Badger is a browser add-on that stops advertisers and other
    third-party trackers from secretly tracking where you go and what pages you look
    at on the web. &nbsp;If an advertiser seems to be tracking you across multiple
    websites without your permission, Privacy Badger automatically blocks that advertiser
    from loading any more content in your browser. &nbsp;To the advertiser, it's like
    you suddenly disappeared.
