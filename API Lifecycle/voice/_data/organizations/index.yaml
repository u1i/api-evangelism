  name: AWS Polly
  description: Amazon Polly is a service that turns text into lifelike speech. Polly
    lets you create applications that talk, enabling you to build entirely new categories
    of speech-enabled products. Polly is an Amazon AI service that uses advanced deep
    learning technologies to synthesize speech that sounds like a human voice. Polly
    includes 47 lifelike voices spread across 24 languages, so you can select the
    ideal voice and build speech-enabled applications that work in many different
    countries. Amazon Polly delivers the consistently fast response times required
    to support real-time, interactive dialog. You can cache and save Polly&rsquo;s
    speech audio to replay offline or redistribute. And Polly is easy to use. You
    simply send the text you want converted into speech to the Polly API, and Polly
    immediately returns the audio stream to your application so your application can
    play it directly or store it in a standard audio file format, such as MP3. With
    Polly, you only pay for the number of characters you convert to speech, and you
    can save and replay Polly&rsquo;s generated speech. Polly&rsquo;s low cost per
    character converted, and lack of restrictions on storage and reuse of voice output,
    make it a cost-effective way to enable Text-to-Speech everywhere.
