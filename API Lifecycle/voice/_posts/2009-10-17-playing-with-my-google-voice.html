I was playing with my<a href="https://www.google.com/voice/"> Google Voice</a> the last couple days. If I got more phone calls I could definitely see it being a bigger part of my life.<p></p>
Then I started playing with it more. I can get <a class="zem_slink" title="Text messaging" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging">text messages</a> using my <a href="https://www.google.com/voice/https://www.google.com/voice/">Google Voice</a> phone number. Nice.<p></p>
Then I called my number and left a voice mail for myself. Pretty soon it came in and I saw a "processing" message at the bottom of message.<p></p>
Pretty soon the <a class="zem_slink" title="Voice message" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_message">voice message</a> showed up as text in my Google Voice inbox. Very cool <a class="zem_slink" title="Speech recognition" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition">speech recognition</a>. I don't remember talking very clear or anything and it got what i said word for word.<p></p>
Then about a couple minutes later I noticed there was an email in my gmail account. About this time I was already thinking...is there an API for this? So I can get at these messages.<p></p>
Then there was the good ol email API....it would be very easy to check my designated email account and look for specific keyword like blog, twitter or whatever I want. I would do this programatically of course. I could route these email messages anywhere I wanted.<p></p>
I then would have my own speech recognition API that I could use as gateway for any of my other systems and services that API's.<p></p>
Sure there are services out there that will give you a voice mail number and you call it and say keywords and then message...it speech rocognizes then sends to API of your choice. But they cost you money.<p></p>
This is a layer of your FREE <a href="https://www.google.com/voice/">Google Voice</a> service. That you can integrate with other systems. You could route messages to different systems for process, publishing and collaboration. They could be message from you or not.<p></p>
Interesting stuff.... will evaluate more.
