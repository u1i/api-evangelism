My Firefox browser opens all my <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/?p=1005">default tabs</a> when it opens and gives me quick access to all my core web applications. One of these is <a href="https://www.google.com/voice/">Google Voice</a>.<p></p>
I am still working <a href="https://www.google.com/voice/">Google Voice</a> into my overall platform. It isn't quite there.<p></p>
Today I was thinking about some good uses for it beyond receiving calls. I was mourning the deactivation of Google Notebook and thinking that Google Voice would make a good replacement for my note taking. Make it more verbal. I would like to see Google Voice to be integrated through my <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/?p=626">Google Office</a>. When editing a document I could leave audio notes. When creating or editing a calendar event I could leave audio notes. These notes would show up in my <a href="https://www.google.com/voice/">Google Voice</a> account and I could organize or maybe they would automatically organize by <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/?p=626">Google Application</a>?<p></p>
I have a Google Voice widget on my web site so people could call me. Seems like Google could release a simple widget I could use and call myself. Then I could leave messages, notes, and general dictation. These audio notes would then be transcribed and available as part of my overall communication stream.<p></p>
Just some random thoughts of how I see Google Voice growing and evolving as part of my core platform.
