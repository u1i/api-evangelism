Amazon just launched a new analysis tool for Amazon S3 called, S3Stat. This tool uses the log files generated by S3, analyzes them using <a href="http://www.mrunix.net/webalizer/">Webalizer</a>, and generates a variety of reports.   Take a look at the <a href="http://www.s3stat.com/web-stats/sample-reports.ashx">sample reports</a> to learn more.  There's a one-month free trial and usage after that costs just $2 per month. Take a look at the <a href="http://www.s3stat.com/web-stats/pricing.ashx">pricing plan</a> to learn more. While you are on the site you may want to take a look at their list of <a href="http://www.s3stat.com/web-stats/S3-resources.ashx">S3 resources</a> as well.
