My GF is Audrey Watters @ ReadWriteWeb, so I get exposed to an authors daily perspective in the tech blogging world.<p></p>
I started harvesting all the RSS feeds from <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com" target="_blank">ReadWriteWeb</a>, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com" target="_blank">Techcrunch</a>, <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com" target="_blank">O'Reilly</a>, <a href="http://www.mashable.com" target="_blank">Mashable</a>, <a href="http://www.venturebeat.com" target="_blank">VentureBeat</a>, and <a href="http://www.gigaom.com" target="_blank">GigaOm</a>.<p></p>
Upon harvest I would organize the post and curate author details, tags, etc. I had a whole bunch of scripts I'd run to clean up, organize and centralize meta data.<p></p>
I would then pull the tweets for each post daily using BackType.<p></p>
I would then build profiles for each twitter user with their # of followers, tweets etc....as well as their Trustrnk using InfoChimps.<p></p>
When I started I was profile the individual blogs, and quickly saw the true value is in the tech blogger and their brand. I think there is an important story here:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>What topics to they cover most? Specialize in?</li>
	<li>Who has the strong brand? Number of Followers? Importance in certain topics.</li>
	<li>Who are their influential followers? Loyalty? Trustrnk?</li>
	<li>What do their followers pay attention to?</li>
</ul>
There is a lot of information here. I had the data harvesting for last 6 months, it was being refined and had a crude web interface setup. I wanted to provide a directory of Tech Bloggers and their brands with real-time stats on what they are writing on their personal and professional blogs.  Think Postrank, BackType, Crunchbase for Bloggers.<p></p>
I think the future of tech journalism is about the individual writers and their brands. I think writers would find this information valuable. I also think industry leaders would find this information valuable also. I see a lot of corporations investing in tech writers and their brand. I see writer brands becoming just as, or more important than the domain based brands we see today.<p></p>
I would like to restart this project, but just can't afford the EC2, RDS and bandwidth charges if I'm not moving forward. If you are interested, you can contact me.
