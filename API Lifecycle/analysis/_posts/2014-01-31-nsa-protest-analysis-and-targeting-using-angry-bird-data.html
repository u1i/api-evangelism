<p>The public recently found out that the NSA uses leaky applications such as Angry Birds to track on and find out more about every day citizens around the world. There is a wealth of data available regarding the potential of Angry Bird users, where they travel to, how they spend their leisure time, and potentially their understanding of physics.</p>
<p>One very important application for this type of surveillance of citizens is in the area of crowd control, and protest analysis. By tracking users ability to successfully target birds, and fling pings in Angry Birds, you can quickly assess which users will potentially be the most successful in throwing of rocks and other objects during a protest.</p>
<p>When you couple this profile data, with the ability to target these individuals using their cell phone signal in a crowd, you can quickly identify the individuals in a crowd who will potential cause the most damage , as well as injury to law enforcement if things get ugly. However in this scenario, rather than throwing of virtual pigs at birds, protesters will be hurling other objects at angry pigs.</p>
<p>Using big data analysis, law enforcement can easily target these threatening individuals in a crowd, conduct an initial sweep of the crowd and eliminate the threat to law enforcement. This will ensure that large crowds and protests, when they turn violent will minimize the threat to officers and potentially reduce property destruction.</p>
