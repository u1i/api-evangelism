With the amount of data being made available every day, visualizing tools are increasingly important. <img class="alignnone" style="padding: 15px;" title="US Map Visualization" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/US-Map.PNG" alt="" width="300" align="right" /><p></p>
The average user needs to see data rolled up in a way that is attractive and easy to understand.<p></p>
I'm going to be keeping my eye out for easy to use tools that help us data scientist transform data into meaningful visualizations.<p></p>
I found an <a href="http://www.flashusamap.com/statistics.php">Interactive Flash US Map</a> that you can easily plug in the criteria for each US State.<p></p>
The only thing I would add is for them to make a more variable API that allows people to connect the data source of their choice, like a Google Spreadsheet.
