    coordinate components and step through the functions of your application.
    Step Functions provides a graphical console to arrange and visualize the
    components of your application as a series of steps. This makes it simple to
    build and run multi-step applications. Step Functions automatically triggers
    and tracks each step, and retries when there are errors, so your application
    executes in order and as expected. Step Functions logs the state of each
    step, so when things do go wrong, you can diagnose and debug problems
    quickly. You can change and add steps without even writing code, so you can
    easily evolve your application and innovate faster.  AWS Step Functions
    manages the operations and underlying infrastructure for you to help ensure
    your application is available at any scale.
