    that treat webhooks like subscriptions. These subscriptions are manipulated
    via a REST API just like any other resource.

    Run code with an HTTP call. No provisioning. No deployment. Run server-side
    code for your JavaScript and native applications. Just worry about your
    code. Run code on each Stripe Payment, a GitHub Push, or any webhook,
    without setting up servers. Allow your customers to extend your product
    using Node.js code instead of creating your own DSL.

    Webscripts respond to HTTP requests, making them easy to call from web and
    mobile apps. Webscripts have all the features you need, like password
    hashing and persistent storage, plus the full programmability of Lua. Many
    developer tools, such as GitHub and Stripe, offer webhooks as a way of
    delivering notifications. Webscripts are a fast and easy way to receive
    those webhooks. Our built-in request logging makes them equally easy to
    debug on-the-fly. Webscripts can also be activated on a schedule, providing
    a simple way to build monitoring or other automation.
