    These are the news items I've curated in my monitoring of the API space that
    have some relevance to the API definition conversation and I wanted to
    include in my research. I'm using all of these links to better understand
    how the space is testing their APIs, going beyond just monitoring and
    understand the details of each request and response.

    If you think there is a link I should have listed here feel free to tweet it
    at me, or submit as a Github issue. Even though I do this full time, I'm
    still a one person show, and I miss quite a bit, and depend on my network to
    help me know what is going on.
