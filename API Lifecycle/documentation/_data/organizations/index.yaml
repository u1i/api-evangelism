    ReadMe is a developer hub for your startup or code. It's a completely
    customizable and collaborative place for documentation, support, key
    generation and more. Don't waste your precious time reimplementing a
    dev.yourstartup.com. If you have an API, code library, or affiliate program,
    documentation is hard. Users can't use your product without understanding
    it, and most documentation on the Internet is lacking. The goal of ReadMe is
    to make consuming APIs completely painless.
