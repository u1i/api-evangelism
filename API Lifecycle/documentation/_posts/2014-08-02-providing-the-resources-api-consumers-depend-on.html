<p><span>The current web API movement has been building for almost 14 years, started by API pioneers like SalesForce and Amazon, resulting in some pretty proven models for what types of resources API consumers need for a successful integration. When you look at the central developer areas for <span>SalesForce</span> and Amazon, but also for new players like Twilio and SendGrid, you see some consistent resources present between all of them, ensuring API consumers have what they need for building web, mobile, and single page applications, and increasingly to connect to physical devices in our every day world.</span><br /> <br /> <span>The minimum viable resources you need to support a central API developer program are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview</strong> - A simple, clear, and concise description of what a developer program is intended to do, with introduction to the API resources that are available within a developer program.</li>
<li><strong>Getting Started -</strong> Easy to follow, step by step instructions on how to get started using an API, and to take an application from idea to production with as little friction as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Self Service Registration - </strong>Even if developers need further approval to get full access, some sort of self-service, 24/7 access to a developer area is the standard protocol for most API platforms--requiring developers to register, but can get at least limited access to APIs at any time.</li>
<li><strong>API Reference / Documentation -</strong> Intuitive, simple, and up to date documentation of all API endpoints, and the authentication process is standard procedure, with many APIs providing also delivering some sort of interactive documentation using formats like Swagger or API Blueprint.</li>
<li><strong>Code Samples &amp; SDKs - </strong>An suite of code samples, libraries, and SDKs should be made available in top programming languages like PHP, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, Java, C#, and possibly leading languages like Go, for developers to put to use in their integrations.</li>
<li><strong>Blog -</strong> An active blog, with RSS, provides a single communication channel that API consumers can depend on to receive updates about API and its parent companies operation.</li>
<li><strong>Forum - </strong>Forums, either self-hosted by the API provider, or taking advantage of existing public forums like Stack Exchange, provide an indirect channel for developers to obtain support from the API provider, or from their community of peers.</li>
<li><strong>Access Levels &amp; Pricing &nbsp;- </strong>Providing a transparent summary of API access levels, alongside any pricing that applies to the levels of API access available, provides clear information for API consumers to consider as they plan their integrations.</li>
<li><strong>Terms and Conditions - </strong>Covering the legal aspects of API operations in a way that protects the API providers interests, as well as allowing API consumers enough room to build and operate businesses around their API integrations, is a standard practice within all API developer programs.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>There are other bells and whistles you can add in, like a Twitter account or putting Github to work, but API pioneers like <span>SalesForce</span>, Flickr, Twitter and Google have established a common set of essential API building blocks through trial and error over the last decade&mdash;leaving this simple checklists that thousands of other API providers follow, making it a default for all APIs.</span><br /> <br /> <span>Internal, student, or external vendors will look to a centralized developer program, containing a consistent number of resources, delivered in a way that matches what people have grown accustom to, when integrating with APIs across the public and private sector over the last decade.&nbsp;</span></p>
