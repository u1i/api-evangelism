<p>After working on the <a href="http://explore.data.gov.apievangelist.com/domains-api.html">federal agency domain API</a>, under the explore.data.gov domain, there were three high value API from usa.gov I wanted to tackle next. I'm <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/10/low-hanging-fruit-for-api-discovery-in-the-federal-government/">looking for the lowest hanging fruit</a> when it comes to demonstrating the potential of <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, for API discovery across the federal government.</p>
<p>The GSA has three pretty valuable API resources hosted at www.usa.gov:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://www.usa.gov/About/developer-resources/federal-agency-directory/index.shtmlwww.usa.gov">Federal Agency Directory API</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.usa.gov/About/developer-resources/social-media-registry.shtml">Social Media Registry API</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.usa.gov/About/developer-resources/mobile-app-gallery/index.shtml">Mobile App Gallery API Documentation</a></li>
</ul>
<p>My end goal here is to create an APIs.json for the www.usa.gov domain, so I needed machine readable definitions for each of these three APIs. I wanted the APIs.json to reference all three API pages at www.usa.gov, as well as Swagger definition for each one.</p>
<p>As I do with all my projects, I started a Github repository to track all my work, this is the result...</p>
