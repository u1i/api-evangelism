description: 'Gluu provides open source authentication and API access management stack,
  called the Gluu Server, helps companies secure Web and mobile applications. The
  Gluu Server leverages standards such as OAuth2, OpenID Connect, UMA, SAML 2.0, and
  SCIM to enable federated single sign-on (SSO) and trust elevation. The Gluu Server
  is used by universities, government agencies, and companies to secure employee facing
  and consumer network services. Deployed on one or more dedicated servers and the
  IaaS platform of your choice, the Gluu Server improves the quality and drives down
  the cost of an increasingly complex and mission critical IT service: authentication
  and authorization (AA).'
