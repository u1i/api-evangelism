<p>I am updating my WalkSensor profile for the month. I like to take a look at my profile each month, stay up to date on the providers that I contribute data to, and consider any possible new additions to my profile. Right now I gather data for 28 separate companies, organizations, and the city of Portland, OR where I live.  When I walk to work each day, which is about 1.4 miles, I scan about 93 separate sensors, for all of my 28 companies, organizations and government agencies.</p>
<p>I started walking to work each day for my health, and I kept walking because of WalkSensor. I get to gather data from water, electrical, weather, and other sensors place around my neighborhood and larger city. Rather than companies connecting each sensor directly on the Internet for information gathering, it was more cost effective, and secure to give each sensor the ability to transmit a data signal for a small radius, say like 30 feet. These signals can be picked up by any regular mobile smart phone, but it requires the WalkSensor app to actually accept, decrypt, and store each signals message.</p>
<p>When I get to work, or get back home, whichever is the first location I connect to a secure wifi connection, the gathered data is transmitted to each companies WalkSensor server. The process is a win for everyone involved--each company, organization, or government agency is able to deploy low cost sensors, and I am able to generate some revenue, pushing me to walk to work, rather than driving.  I get to choose who I gather data for, and I only work for them if I have an affinity with their mission, and data collection goals.</p>
<p>I do not make much money, about $50.00 a month, but it makes it worth it. I can earn extra money by taking walks in the evening or on weekends. Companies have specific data gathering needs, and my WalkSensor app will aggregate potential opportunities for me, and plan a trip for me, encouraging me to go for a walk. I like that I am supporting a different vision of the Internet of Things, one that doesn&rsquo;t involve everything being connected to the Internet, and allows for much more sensible and controlled way to connect devices to a central online platform.</p>
