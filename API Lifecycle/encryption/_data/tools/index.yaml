  description: >-
    Google's Certificate Transparency project fixes several structural flaws in
    the SSL certificate system, which is the main cryptographic system that
    underlies all HTTPS connections. These flaws weaken the reliability and
    effectiveness of encrypted Internet connections and can compromise critical
    TLS/SSL mechanisms, including domain validation, end-to-end encryption, and
    the chains of trust set up by certificate authorities. If left unchecked,
    these flaws can facilitate a wide range of security attacks, such as website
    spoofing, server impersonation, and man-in-the-middle attacks.
