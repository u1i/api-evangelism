  name: Certificate Transparency
  description: >-
    Google's Certificate Transparency project fixes several structural flaws in
    the SSL certificate system, which is the main cryptographic system that
    underlies all HTTPS connections. These flaws weaken the reliability and
    effectiveness of encrypted Internet connections and can compromise critical
    TLS/SSL mechanisms, including domain validation, end-to-end encryption, and
    the chains of trust set up by certificate authorities. If left unchecked,
    these flaws can facilitate a wide range of security attacks, such as website
    spoofing, server impersonation, and man-in-the-middle attacks.

  description: >-
    AWS Certificate Manager is a service that lets you easily provision, manage,
    and deploy Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS)
    certificates for use with AWS services. SSL/TLS certificates are used to
    secure network communications and establish the identity of websites over
    the Internet. AWS Certificate Manager removes the time-consuming manual
    process of purchasing, uploading, and renewing SSL/TLS certificates. With
    AWS Certificate Manager, you can quickly request a certificate, deploy it on
    AWS resources such as Elastic Load Balancers or Amazon CloudFront
    distributions, and let AWS Certificate Manager handle certificate renewals.
    SSL/TLS certificates provisioned through AWS Certificate Manager are free.
    You pay only for the AWS resources you create to run your application.

  description: >-
    AWS Key Management Service (KMS) is a managed service that makes it easy for
    you to create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt your data, and
    uses Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) to protect the security of your keys.
    AWS Key Management Service is integrated with several other AWS services to
    help you protect the data you store with these services. AWS Key Management
    Service is also integrated with AWS CloudTrail to provide you with logs of
    all key usage to help meet your regulatory and compliance needs.

  name: AWS CloudHSM
  description: >-
    The AWS CloudHSM service helps you meet corporate, contractual and
    regulatory compliance requirements for data security by using dedicated
    Hardware Security Module (HSM) appliances within the AWS cloud. With
    CloudHSM, you control the encryption keys and cryptographic operations
    performed by the HSM. AWS and AWS Marketplace partners offer a variety of
    solutions for protecting sensitive data within the AWS platform, but for
    applications and data subject to rigorous contractual or regulatory
    requirements for managing cryptographic keys, additional protection is
    sometimes necessary. Until now, your only option was to store the sensitive
    data (or the encryption keys protecting the sensitive data) in your
    on-premises datacenters. Unfortunately, this either prevented you from
    migrating these applications to the cloud or significantly slowed their
    performance. The AWS CloudHSM service allows you to protect your encryption
    keys within HSMs designed and validated to government standards for secure
    key management. You can securely generate, store, and manage the
    cryptographic keys used for data encryption such that they are accessible
    only by you. AWS CloudHSM helps you comply with strict key management
    requirements without sacrificing application performance. The AWS CloudHSM
    service works with Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). CloudHSM instances
    are provisioned inside your VPC with an IP address that you specify,
    providing simple and private network connectivity to your Amazon Elastic
    Compute Cloud (EC2) instances. Placing CloudHSM instances near your EC2
    instances decreases network latency, which can improve application
    performance. AWS provides dedicated and exclusive (single tenant) access to
    CloudHSM instances, isolated from other AWS customers. Available in multiple
    Regions and Availability Zones (AZs), AWS CloudHSM allows you to add secure
    and durable key storage to your applications.
