    These are the blog posts I've writen on API Evangelist that I've tagged as
    "deployment". Usually because they have some elements that speaks to why or
    how APIs are being deployed from scratch or using existing services and
    platforms.

    If you have a story you think I should telling about I recommend you write
    up the thought on your own blog and share a link with me, or feel free to
    submit a Github issue on this research project's repository, or use of the
    other channels available on the contact page.
