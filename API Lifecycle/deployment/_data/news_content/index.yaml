    These are the news items I've curated in my monitoring of the API space that
    are related to deploying APIs and thought worth enough to include in my
    research. I'm using all of these links to better understand how APIs are
    being deployed across a diverse range of implementations.

    If you think there is a link I should have listed here feel free to tweet it
    at me, or submit as a Github issue. Even though I do this full time, I'm
    still a one person show, and I miss quite a bit, and depend on my network to
    help me know what is going on.
