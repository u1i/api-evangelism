<h2>Contributing To The Deployment Lifecycle</h2>
<p>Automatically generating an API, from a machine readable definition, has long been the dream of API providers. In reality, this is much harder to achieve, than one might think, but there has been significant work from leading API design service providers and their developer communities, and in 2014, you can indeed auto generate an API from your API definition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;API definitions like&nbsp;API Blueprint, RAML, or Swagger, do what they do best--describe your interface. How this merges with the actual deployment of an API backend, is not always evident. Depending on how you craft your API definition, it may contain your underlying data model, and for simpler data or content APIs, auto generation of a backend might be possible.</p>
<p>When it comes to more complex API resources, there will undoubtedly be much more magic behind the interface, requiring connection with unique backend systems, and code libraries. I&rsquo;m confident that the API community will continue to produce API definition driven, connectors for common IT systems, further evolving on the vision of automatically generating of APIs from their machine readable API definitions&mdash;replacing much of what more traditional service gateways have always delivered.</p>
<p>There is also a new evolution in cloud computing, one that will contribute significantly to API deployment, being called containers. New approaches to deploying application resources, from Docker, and subsequently Amazon, Red Hat, Google, Microsoft, and others, will rapidly escalate how we deploy the APIs that we depend on. API definitions provide a perfect interface definition, for resources that are deployed as containers. We are just missing the linking between current container deployment definitions, and the evolving world of API definitions&mdash;a link that will come into focus in 2014.</p>
