<p>My goal with this portal is to make it all driven by APIs.json, so I can use as a template for portals, that anyone can fork, and quickly generate an API developer that meets my minimum definition of an APIs.json portal.</p>
<p>The navigation, home page, and almost every other section is pulling its content and references from the master APIs.json, as well as the rest of the 25+ APIs in this index.</p>
<p>There are still a lot of manual details for me, when keeping the APIs.json index up to date, but it is paying off. I have parts of my APIs indexed, like I never had before. This is allowing me to keep better in tune with the details of each API.</p>
