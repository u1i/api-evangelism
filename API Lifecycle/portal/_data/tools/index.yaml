  name: Jekyll
  description: Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template
    directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through Markdown
    (or Textile) and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish
    static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server. Jekyll also
    happens to be the engine behind GitHub Pages, which means you can use Jekyll to
    host your project&rsquo;s page, blog, or website from GitHub&rsquo;s servers for
    free.
