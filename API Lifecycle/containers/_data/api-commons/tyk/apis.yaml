description: An open source, lightweight, fast and scalable API Gateway. Set rate
  limiting, request throttling, and auto-renewing request quotas to manage how your
  users access your API. Tyk supports access tokens, HMAC request signing, basic authentication
  and OAuth 2.0 to integrate old and new services easily. Tyk can record and store
  detailed analytics which can be segmented by user, error, endpoint and client ID
  across multiple APIs and versions. Integrate your existing or new applications with
  Tyk using a simple REST API, Tyk even support hot-reloads so you can introduce new
  services without downtime.
