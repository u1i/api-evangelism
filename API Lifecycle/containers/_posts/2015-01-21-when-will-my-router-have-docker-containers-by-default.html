<p>This is something I&rsquo;m working on building manually, but when will the wireless router for my home or business have Docker container support by default? I want to be able to deploy applications, and APIs either publicly or privately right on my own doorway to the Internet.</p>
<p>This would take more work than just adding storage, compute, and Docker support at the router level. To enable this there would have to be changes at the network level, and is something I&rsquo;m not sure telco and cable providers are willing to support. I&rsquo;ll be researching this as a concept over the next couple months, so if you know of any read-to-go solutions, let me know.</p>
<p>It seems like enabling a local layer for docker deployment would make sense, and help move us towards a more programmable web, where notifications, messaging, storage, and other common elements of our digital lives can live locally. It seems like it would be a valuable aggregation point as the Internet of Thing heats up.</p>
<p>I could envision webhooks management, and other Internet of Things for household automation living in this local, containerized, layer of our online worlds. This is just a thought. I&rsquo;ve done no research to flush this idea out, which is why its here on kinlane.com. If you know of anything feel free to send information my way.</p>
