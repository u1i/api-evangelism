<p><img src="{{ page.image }}" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>We are getting closer to [the 9th edition of APIStrat happening in Nashville, TN this September 24th through 26th](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/). [The schedule for the conference is up](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/program/schedule/), along with [the first lineup of keynote speakers](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/program/keynote_speakers/), and my drumbeat of stories about the event continues here on the blog. Next up in our session lineup is _"Testing and Meaningful Mocks in a Microservice System"_  by Laura Medalia (@codergirl__) of Care/Of on September 25th.

Here is Laura's abstract for the session:

_Laura will be talking about tooling for mocking microservice endpoints in a meaningful way using Open API specifications. She will cover how to set up microservice deployments processes so that with each versioned microservice deployed a mock of the service with up to date contracts will also be deployed. Laura will also show how to use tooling she and her team built to consume these lightweight mocks in unit tests and either get default mock responses or mock out custom responses for different test cases._

In an era where many API development groups are working to move to a design and mock first approach, this session will be key to our journey, and APIStrat is where we all need to be. [You can register for the event here](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/attend/register/), and there [are still sponsorship opportunities available](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/sponsor/). Don't miss out on APIStrat this year--it is going to be a good time in Nashville as we continue the conversation we started back in 2012 with the initial edition of the API industry event in New York City.

I am looking forward to seeing you all in Nashville next month!
