<p><img src="{{ page.image }}" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>I import and work with a number of OpenAPI definitions that I come across in the wild. When I come across a version 1.2, 2.0, 3.0 OpenAPI, I import them into my API monitoring system for publishing as part of my research. After the initial import of any OpenAPI definition, the first thing I look for is the consistent in the naming of paths, the availability of summary, descriptions, as well as tags. The naming conventions used is paths is all over the place, some are cleaner than others. Most have a summary, with fewer having descriptions, but I'd say about 80% of them do not have any tags available for each API path.

Tags for each API path are essential to labeling the value a resource delivers. I'm surprised that API providers don't see the need for applying these tags. I'm guessing it is because they don't have to work with many external APIs, and really haven't put much thought into other people working with their OpenAPI definition beyond it just driving their own documentation. Many people still see OpenAPI as simply a driver of API documentation on their portal, and not as an API discovery, or complete lifecycle solution that is portable beyond their platform. Not considering how tags applied to each API resource will help others index, categorize, and organize APIs based upon the value in delivers.

I have a couple of algorithms that help me parse the path, summary, and description to generate tags for each path, but it is something I'd love for API providers to think more deeply about. It goes beyond just the resources available via each path, and the tags should reflect the overall value an API delivers. If it is a product, event, messaging, or other resource, I can extract a tag from the path, but the path doesn't always provide a full picture, and I regularly find myself adding more tags to each API(if I have the time). This means that many of the APIs I'm profiling, and adding to my [API Stack](http://theapistack.com), [API Gallery](http://api.gallery.streamdata.io/), and other work isn't as complete with metadata as they possibly could be. Something API providers should be more aware of, and helping define as part of their hand crafting, or auto-generation of OpenAPI definitions.

It is important for API providers to see their OpenAPI definitions as more than just a localized, static feature of their platforms, and as a portable definition that will be used by 3rd party API service providers, as well as their API consumers. They should be linking their OpenAPI prominently from your API documentation, and not hiding behind the JavaScript voodoo that generates your docs. They should be making sure OpenAPI definitions are as complete as you possibly can, with as much metadata as possible, describing the value that it delivers. Loading up OpenAPI definitions into a variety of API design, documentation, discovery, testing, and other tooling to see what it looks like and how it behaves. API providers will find that tags are beginning to be used for much more than just grouping of paths in your API documentation, and it is how gateways are organizing resources, management solutions are defining monetization and billing, and API discovery solutions are using to drive their API search solutions--to just point out a couple of ways in which they are used.

Tag your APIs as part of your OpenAPI definitions! I know that many API providers are still auto-generating from a system, but once they have published the latest copy, make sure you load up in one of the leading API design tools, and give that last little bit of polish. Think of it as that last bit of API editorial workflow that ensures your API definitions speak to the widest possible audience, and are as coherent as it possibly can. Your API definitions tell a story about the resources you are making available, and the tags help provide a much more precise way to programmatically interpret what APIs actually deliver. Without them APIs might not properly show up in search engine and Github searches, or render coherently in other API services and tooling. OpenAPI tags are an essential part of defining and organizing your API resources--give them the attention they deserve.
