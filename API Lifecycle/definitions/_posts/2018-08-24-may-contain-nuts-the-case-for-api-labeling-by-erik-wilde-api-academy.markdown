<p><img src="{{ page.image }}" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>We are getting closer to [the 9th edition of APIStrat happening in Nashville, TN this September 24th through 26th](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/). [The schedule for the conference is up](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/program/schedule/), along with [the first lineup of keynote speakers](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/program/keynote_speakers/), and my drumbeat of stories about the event continues here on the blog. Next up in our session lineup is _"[May Contain Nuts: The Case for API Labeling](http://sched.co/FTQM)"_ by Erik Wilde (@dret), API Academy (@apiacademy) on September 25th.

Here is Erik's background set the stage for his session:

_Erik is a frequent speaker at both industry and academia events. In his current role at the API Academy, his work revolves around API strategy, design, and management, and how to help organizations with their digital transformation. Based on his extensive background in Web architecture and technologies, Erik combines deep expertise in protocols and representations with insights into API practices at today's organizations._

_Before joining API Academy and working in the API space full-time, Erik spent time at Siemens and EMC, in both cases working at ways how APIs could be used for their internal service ecosystems, as well as for better ways for customers to use services and products. Before that, Erik spent most of his life in academia, working at UC Berkeley and ETH Zürich. Erik received his Ph.D. in computer science from ETH Zürich, and his diploma in computer science from TU Berlin._

Erik nows his stuff, and can be found on the road with the CA API Academy, making this stop in Nashville, TN a pretty special opportunity. [You can register for the event here](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/attend/register/), and there [are still sponsorship opportunities available](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/sponsor/). Don't miss out on APIStrat this year--it is going to be a good time in Nashville as we continue the conversation we started back in 2012 with the initial edition of the API industry event in New York City.

I am looking forward to seeing you all in Nashville next month!
