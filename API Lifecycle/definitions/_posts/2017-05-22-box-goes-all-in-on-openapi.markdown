<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/box/embracing-openapi-at-box.png" align="right" width="35%" /></p>Box has gone all in on OpenAPI. [They have published an OpenAPI for their document and storage API on Github](https://github.com/box/box-openapi), where it can be used in a variety of tools and services, as well as be maintained as part of the Box platform operations. Adding to the number of high-profile APIs managing their OpenAPI definitions on Github, like Box, and [the NY Times](http://apievangelist.com/2017/03/01/new-york-times-manages-their-openapi-using-github/).

As part of their OpenaPI release, [Box published a blog post that touches on all the major benefits of having an OpenAPI](https://medium.com/box-developer-blog/embracing-openapi-swagger-at-box-3e9239a57db6), like forking on Github for integration into your workflow, generating documentation and visualizations, code, mock APIs, and even [monitoring and testing using Runscope](https://www.runscope.com/). It's good to see a major API provider drinking the OpenAPI Kool-Aid, and working to reduce friction for their developers.

I would love to not be in the business of crafting complete OpenAPIs for API providers. I would like every single API provider to be maintaining their own OpenAPI on Github like [Box](https://github.com/box/box-openapi) and [NY Times(http://apievangelist.com/2017/03/01/new-york-times-manages-their-openapi-using-github/) does. Then I (we) could spend time indexing, curating, and developing interesting tooling and visualizations to help us tell stories around APIs, helping developers and business owners understand what is possible with the growing number of APIs available today.
