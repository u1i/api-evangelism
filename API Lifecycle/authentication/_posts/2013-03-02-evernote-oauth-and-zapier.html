<p>One of the platforms I depend upon for my memory was hacked today.  This afternoon, Evernote let everyone know that the platform was compromised and forced a reset of all passwords.</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;d prefer all platforms I depend on could thwart any hacks, it seems like security breaches are becoming par for the course.</p>
<p>I appreciate that Evernote immediately forced a password reset and because I use the desktop app, I immediately was prompted to update my password. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I also enjoy seeing the OAuth flow in action, where <a href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/reciprocity.php">reciprocity providers like Zapier</a> immediately take action. &nbsp;By 2:57 PM I get an email from Evernote, letting me know of situation:</p>

<p>Next at 3:56 PM I receive an email from Zapier, letting me know I should have received email from Evernote and to check my connections:</p>

<p>I immediately update my OAuth token for Evernote, via the Zapier dashboard:</p>

<p>Next I get an email from Evernote, letting me know I&rsquo;ve successfully been connected to Zapier.</p>

<p>I really like seeing OAuth in action.  It makes me really evaluate how my network of cloud services can work together.  OAuth and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/reciprocity.php">reciprocity services like Zapier</a> help me integrate, automate and make my world go around in a secure way I can depend on.</p>
<p>There was a <a href="http://evernote.com/corp/news/password_reset.php">security breach today, on the Evernote platform, a service I depend on</a>, but because of quick action by Evernote as well as Zapier, my Google Docs and Evernote integration has resumed, migrating vital data and content securely after only a minor disruption.</p>
