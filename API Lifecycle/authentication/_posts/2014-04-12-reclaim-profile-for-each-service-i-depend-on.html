<p>As I&rsquo;m going through each of the 50+ services I depend on, and change my password this weekend, I want to apply a little critical reclaim my domain thinking to each service as I pass through. I&rsquo;m not naive to think I will be able to reclaim 100% of my domain, but I should have a bar defined, of what I expect from each provider in the area of domain management.</p>
<p>What is the the minimum I need to know about each online service I depend on?</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Why do I use this service?</li>
<li>What content do I generate via this service? (ie. Messages, Images, Videos)</li>
<li>Do I pay for this service?</li>
<li>Does this service provide data portability? (Download of settings and content)</li>
<li>Can I terminate my use of this service?</li>
<li>Does this service have an API?</li>
<li>Does this service offer oAuth?</li>
<li>Does this service offer 2 Factor Authentication?</li>
<li>Do I currently integrate with this services API?</li>
</ul>
<p>That will do for now. Eventually I&rsquo;m sure I will have more questions I will need to ask, but for this round I am just looking to generate a profile each service and identify whether or not they have an API.</p>
<p>By establishing a Reclaim Profile for each online service, I will have mapped out my online domain--where I exist online, and potentially where I generate content and other information I may want to reclaim.</p>
