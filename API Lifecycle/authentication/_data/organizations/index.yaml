    In addition, Amazon Cognito enables you to save data locally on users
    devices, allowing your applications to work even when the devices are
    offline. You can then synchronize data across users devices so that their
    app experience remains consistent regardless of the device they use. With
    Amazon Cognito, you can focus on creating great app experiences instead of
    worrying about building, securing, and scaling a solution to handle user
    management, authentication, and sync across devices.

    certified to FIPS 140-2 level 2 and Common Criteria EAL4+ standards, so that
    your keys stay within the HSM boundary. Key Vault is designed so that
    Microsoft does not see or extract your keys. Create new keys for Dev-Test in

    operations. Key Vault scales to meet the demands of your cloud applications
    without the hassle required to provision, deploy, and manage HSMs and key
    management software.

    Google supports common OAuth 2.0 scenarios such as those for web server,

    credentials from the Google API Console. Then your client application
    requests an access token from the Google Authorization Server, extracts a
    token from the response, and sends the token to the Google API that you want
    to access. For an interactive demonstration of using OAuth 2.0 with Google
