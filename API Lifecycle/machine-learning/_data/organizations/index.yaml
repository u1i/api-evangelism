  description: Amazon Machine Learning is a service that makes it easy for developers
    of all skill levels to use machine learning technology. Amazon Machine Learning
    provides visualization tools and wizards that guide you through the process of
    creating machine learning (ML) models without having to learn complex ML algorithms
    and technology. Once your models are ready, Amazon Machine Learning makes it easy
    to obtain predictions for your application using simple APIs, without having to
    implement custom prediction generation code, or manage any infrastructure. Amazon
    Machine Learning is based on the same proven, highly scalable, ML technology used
    for years by Amazon&rsquo;s internal data scientist community. The service uses
    powerful algorithms to create ML models by finding patterns in your existing data.
    Then, Amazon Machine Learning uses these models to process new data and generate
    predictions for your application. Amazon Machine Learning is highly scalable and
    can generate billions of predictions daily, and serve those predictions in real-time
    and at high throughput. With Amazon Machine Learning, there is no upfront hardware
    or software investment, and you pay as you go, so you can start small and scale
    as your application grows.

    monetize editorial and user-generated content through contextual affiliate links.   Atma
    Links was designed as a user-friendly alternative to traditional in-text advertising.  Rather
    than inserting distracting and, often, irrelevant advertisements into text, Atma
    Links analyzes web content in real-time to identify references to online products
    in plain text.  Unambiguous references are automatically converted to deep affiliate
    links to retail sites which sell the product being linked.  As a supplemental
    service, Atma also automatically attaches affiliate codes to the regular links
    on a website that are eligible for affiliation.    The Atma Links overlay, or
    pop-up, was built to enhance the reading experience by displaying product specific
    information.  This product data includes up-to-date pricing info as well as multiple
    search options for the specific product being linked.  However,  publishers can
    elect to disable this feature and, instead, render the Atma Links presence on
    content site practically invisible.    Hover display is one of many customizable
    Atma Links features that empower publishers to control the in-text advertising
    on their websites.  With Atma Links, publishers also control the volume, display,
    and relevance of all affiliate links.    For product oriented forums, blogs, and
    web applications, Atma Links delivers significant in-text revenue while preserving
    user experience.

  description: Semantria applies Text and Sentiment Analysis to tweets, facebook posts,
    surveys, reviews or enterprise content. Offering services via API and Excel plugin.
    It is a spinoff of text-analysis software Lexalytics, but differs in that it is
    offered via API and Excel plugin, and in that it incorporates a bigger knowledge
    base and uses deep learning.

  description: 'We are AI enthusiasts on a mission to make deep learning easily available
    to everyone. We focus on building cutting edge tools that can be integrated into
    existing apps cheaply and with minimal work. We work across various models, but
    our focus is on image processing deep learning. For a quick demo of what we can
    do, check out our Fast Demo Page. Our API has been used in a number of applications:
    to build an image transformation mobile app, to create an amazing photo booth,
    and to add a unique twist on custom printing.'

  description: TensorFlow&trade; is an open source software library for numerical
    computation using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical
    operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors)
    communicated between them. The flexible architecture allows you to deploy computation
    to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device with a single
    API.&nbsp;

  description: The service provides analysis of selected text passages to identify
    named entities and statements of fact with disambiguation to distinguish similar
    text strings. It applies machine learning algorithms and natural language processing
    to connect a text sample with a knowledge base and identify known elements and
    their relationships. API methods support submission of a text sample to be parsed.&nbsp;

  description: Wolfram Research is building a computational knowledge engine called
    Wolfram|Alpha for the web to be launched in May 2009. The product will contain
    data in various &nbsp;fields including physical sciences, technology, geography,
    weather, cooking, business, music, etc. in order to provide answers to questions
    that users input. Its language interface will accommodate variations in how users
    frame their questions, such as the use of abbreviations. Wolfram Alpha&rsquo;s
    vision is to create a system which can do for formal knowledge (heuristics, algorithms,
    rules, methods, theorems, etc.) what search engines like Google have done for
    informal knowledge, such as text and documents.
