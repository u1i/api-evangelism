    Auto Scaling helps you maintain application availability and allows you to
    scale your&nbsp;Amazon EC2&nbsp;capacity up or down automatically according
    to conditions you define. You can use Auto Scaling to help ensure that you
    are running your desired number of Amazon EC2 instances. Auto Scaling can
    also automatically increase the number of Amazon EC2 instances during demand
    spikes to maintain performance and decrease capacity during lulls to reduce
    costs. Auto Scaling is well suited both to applications that have stable
    demand patterns or that experience hourly, daily, or weekly variability in
    usage.&nbsp;

    Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes incoming application
    traffic across multiple Amazon EC2 instances. It enables you to achieve
    fault tolerance in your applications, seamlessly providing the required
    amount of load balancing capacity needed to route application traffic.
    Elastic Load Balancing offers two types of load balancers that both feature
    high availability, automatic scaling, and robust security. These include
    the&nbsp;Classic Load Balancer&nbsp;that routes traffic based on either
    application or network level information, and the&nbsp;Application Load
    Balancer&nbsp;that routes traffic based on advanced application level
    information that includes the content of the request. The Classic Load
    Balancer is ideal for simple load balancing of traffic across multiple EC2
    instances, while the Application Load Balancer is ideal for applications
    needing advanced routing capabilities, microservices, and container-based
    architectures. Application Load Balancer offers ability to route traffic to
    multiple services or load balance across multiple ports on the same EC2
    instance.

    indicates that the page is performing well. Please note that PageSpeed
    Insights is being continually improved and so the score will change as we
