<h2>Contributing To The Testing &amp; Monitoring Lifecycle</h2>
<p>When it comes to testing, and monitoring an API, you begin to really see how machine readable API definitions can be the truth, in the contract between API provider and consumer. API definitions are being used by API testing and monitoring services like SmartBear, providing a central set of rules that can ensure your APIs deliver as promised.</p>
<p>Making sure all your APIs operate as expected, and just like generating up to date documentation, you can ensure the entire surface area of your API is tested, and operating as intended. Test driven development (TDD) is becoming common practice for API development, and API definitions will play an increasing role in this side of API operations.</p>
<p>An API definition provides a central truth, that can be used by API providers to monitor API operations, but also give the same set of rules to external API monitoring services, as well as individual API consumers.  Monitoring, and understanding an API up time, from multiple external sources is becoming a part of how the API economy is stabilizing itself, and API definitions provide a portable template, that can be used across all API monitoring services.</p>
<p>Testing and monitoring of vital resources that applications depend on is becoming the norm, with new service providers emerging to assist in this area, and large technology companies like Google, making testing and monitoring default in all platform operations. Without a set of instructions that describe the API surface area, it will be cumbersome, and costly, to generate the automated testing and monitoring jobs necessary to produce a stable, API economy.</p>
