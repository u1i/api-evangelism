<p>The Dreamforce conference is happening this week in San Francisco, a flagship event for the Platform as a Service (PaaS) company. Salesforce is one of the original pioneers in API technology, allowing companies to empower their sales force, using the the latest in technology. Something that in 2015, Salesforce is taking this to the next level, with a handful of attendees, and partners in attendance at the conference.</p>
<p>Using smart pillow technology, Salesforce will be testing out a new set of subliminal mind control APIs. All attendees of the Dreamforce conference have agreed to be part of the tests, through their acceptance of the event terms of service, but only a small group of 500 individuals will actually be targeted. Exactly which attendees are selected will be a secret, even from the handful of 25 partners who will be involved in the test.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through carefully placed hotel pillows, targeted attendees will receive subliminal messages, transmitted via smart pillow APIs developed by Salesforce. Messages will be crafted in association with partners, testing out concepts of directing attendees what they will eat the next day, which sessions they are attending, where they will be going in the exhibit hall, and who they will be networking with The objective is to better understand how open the conference attendees are open to suggestion, in an conference environment.</p>
<p>While some partners of this mind control trial are just doing random tests to see if the technology works, others are looking to implement tasks that are in sync with their sales objectives. Ernst Stavro Blofeld, CEO of Next Generation Staffing Inc, says "the Salesforce test represents the future of industry, and the workforce--this weeks test is about seeing what we can accomplish at a conference, but represents what we will be able to achieve in our workforce on a daily basis."</p>
<p>Salesforce reminded us that this is just a simple test, but an important one that reflects the influence the company already has over its constituents. The company enjoys one of the most loyal base of business users, out of all leading software companies in the world, and this new approach to targeting a loyal base of users, is just the beginning of a new generation of API engineered influence.</p>
