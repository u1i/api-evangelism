    and establish the identity of websites over the Internet. AWS Certificate Manager
    removes the time-consuming manual process of purchasing, uploading, and renewing
    SSL/TLS certificates. With AWS Certificate Manager, you can quickly request a
    certificate, deploy it on AWS resources such as Elastic Load Balancers or Amazon
    CloudFront distributions, and let AWS Certificate Manager handle certificate renewals.
    SSL/TLS certificates provisioned through AWS Certificate Manager are free. You
    pay only for the AWS resources you create to run your application.

  name: AWS Snowball
  description: Snowball is a petabyte-scale data transport solution that uses secure
    appliances to&nbsp;transfer large amounts of data&nbsp;into and out of the&nbsp;AWS
    cloud. Using Snowball addresses common challenges with large-scale data transfers
    including high network costs, long transfer times, and security concerns. Transferring
    data with Snowball is simple, fast, secure, and can be as little as one-fifth
    the cost of high-speed Internet. With Snowball, you don&rsquo;t need to write
    any code or purchase any hardware to transfer your data. Simply create a job in
    the AWS Management Console and a Snowball appliance will be automatically shipped
    to you*. Once it arrives, attach the appliance to your local network, download
    and run the Snowball client to establish a connection, and then use the client
    to select the file directories that you want to transfer to the appliance. The
    client will then encrypt and transfer the files to the appliance at high speed.
    Once the transfer is complete and the appliance is ready to be returned, the E
    Ink shipping label will automatically update and you can track the job status
    via&nbsp;Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS), text messages, or directly
    in the Console. Snowball uses multiple layers of security designed to protect
    your data including tamper-resistant enclosures, 256-bit encryption, and an industry-standard
    Trusted Platform Module (TPM) designed to ensure both security and full chain-of-custody
    of your data. Once the data transfer job has been processed and verified, AWS
    performs a software erasure of the Snowball appliance.

    from common web exploits that could affect application&nbsp;availability, compromise
    security, or consume excessive resources. AWS&nbsp;WAF gives you control over
    which traffic to allow or block to your web&nbsp;applications by defining customizable
    web security rules. You can use AWS&nbsp;WAF to create custom rules that block
    common attack patterns, such as SQL&nbsp;injection or cross-site scripting, and
    rules that are designed for your specific application. New rules can be deployed
    within minutes, letting you respond&nbsp;quickly to changing traffic patterns.
    Also, AWS WAF includes a full-featured&nbsp;API that you can use to automate the
    creation, deployment, and maintenance&nbsp;of web security rules. With AWS WAF
    you pay only for what you use. AWS WAF pricing is based on how many rules you
    deploy and how many web requests your web application receives. There are no upfront
    commitments. You can deploy AWS WAF on either Amazon CloudFront as part of your
    CDN solution or the Application Load Balancer (ALB) that fronts your web servers
    or origin servers running on EC2.&nbsp;
