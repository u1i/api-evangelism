<p><img src="{{ page.image }}" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>I've been learning more about the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) recently, and have been having conversation about compliance with companies in the EU, as well as the US. In short, GDPR requires anyone working with personal data to be up front about the data they collect, making sure what they do with that data is observable to end-users, and takes a privacy and security by design approach when it comes to working with all personal data. While the regulations seems heavy handed and unrealistic to many, it really reflects a healthy view of what personal data is, and what a sustainable digital future will look like.

The biggest challenge with becoming GDPR compliant is the data mess most companies operate in. Most companies collect huge amounts of data, believing it is essential to the value they bring to the table, without no real understanding of everything that is being collected, and any logical reasons behind why it is gathered, stored, and kept around. A "gather it all", big data mentality has dominated the last decade of doing business online. Database groups within organizations hold a lot of power and control because of the data they possess. There is a lot of money to be made when it comes to data access, aggregation, and brokering. It won't be easy to unwind and change the data-driven culture that has emerged and flourished in the Internet age.

I regularly work with companies who do not have coherent maps of all the data they possess. If you asked them for details on what they track about any given customer, very few will be able to give you a consistent answer. Doing web APIs has forced many organizations to think more deeply about what data they posses, and how they can make it more discoverable, accessible, and usable across systems, web, mobile, and device applications. Even with this opportunity, most large organizations are still struggling with what data they have, where it is stored, and how to access it in a consistent, and meaningful way. Database culture within most organizations is just a mess, which contributes to why so many are freaking out about GDPR.

I'm guessing many companies are worried about complying with GDPR, as well as being able to even respond to any sort of regulatory policing event that may occur. This fear is going to force data stewards to begin thinking about the data the have on hand. I've already had conversations with some banks who are working on PSD2 compliant APIs, who are working in tandem on GDPR compliance efforts. Both are making them think deeply about what data they collect, where it is stored, and whether or not it has any value. Something I'm hoping will force some companies to stop collecting some of the data all together, because it just won't be worth justifying its existence in the current cyber(in)secure, and increasingly accountable regulatory environment.

Doing APIs and becoming GDPR compliant go hand in hand. To do APIs you need to map out the data landscape across your organization, something that will contribute to GDPR. To respond to GDPR events, you will need APIs that provide access to end-users data, and leverage API authentication protocols like OAuth to ensure partnerships, and 3rd party access to end-users data are accountable. I'm optimistic that GDPR will continue to push forward healthy, transparent, and observable conversations around our personal data. One that focuses on, and includes the end-users who's data we are collecting, storing, and often time selling. I'm hopeful that the stakes become higher, regarding the penalty for breaches, and shady brokering of personal data, and that GDPR becomes the normal mode of doing business online in the EU, and beyond.
