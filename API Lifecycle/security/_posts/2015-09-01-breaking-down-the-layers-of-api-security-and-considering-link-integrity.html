<p>One of the reasons I setup individual research projects, is to provide me with a structure for better defining each aspect of the API world, something I am working hard to jump-start within my <a href="http://security.apievangelist.com/">API security research</a>. You will notice the project does not have any building blocks defined, <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">which when you compare with one of my oldest research areas</a>, you start to see what I mean.</p>
<p>The blog posts, and other links I curate as part of my API security will help me find companies and tools that are providing value to the space. As I break down each company, and what they offer, I often have to read between the lines, in trying to understand how an API, service, or tool can be used by API providers, as well as potentially API consumers. I am looking for APIs that offer security, but also APIs that offer security to APIs--make sense?</p>
<p>As part of this research, I am playing with <a href="https://metacert.com/">Metacert</a>, which bills itself as &nbsp;a security API for mobile application developers, helping them block malicious ads, phishing links &amp; unwanted pornography inside apps, but I think it is so much more. I could see Metacert being pretty valuable to API providers, as well as API consumers building web and mobile apps. Security isn't always about brute force attacks, and could easily just be in a simple link, added with some content, via your API.</p>
<p>I am adding Metacert to my API security research, with a focus on its potential to API providers. I could see API providers seamlessly integrating <a href="https://metacert.com/api-documentation/getting-started/">the Metacert API</a> into their own stack, processing all links that are submitted through regular operations. I will also be adding link screening like this as a building block to my API security research.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a wise investment in the API security space, you should be talking with Metacert. APIs like Metacert provide us with a model for thinking about how we deliver API driven security services for web, mobile, and IoT applications, but it also provides a potential wholesale API layer that other APIs can use to better secure their own APIs. I consider it a strong blueprint, because its API driven, they have all the essential building blocks, which includes a monetization strategy, and they do one thing, and they do it well.</p>
