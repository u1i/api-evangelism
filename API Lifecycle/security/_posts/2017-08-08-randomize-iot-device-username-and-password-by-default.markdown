<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-iot-signal.png" align="right" width="25%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>I am totally hooked on [POLITICO's Morning Cybersecurity](http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/morning-cybersecurity) email. I'm not an email newsletter guy, but this is government cybersecurity wonky enough to keep me engaged each day. One of the bits that recently grabbed my attention was regarding what should be considered Internet of Things common sense.

[New America's Open Technology Institute argued that IoT device makers should start equipping their products with basic security from the start](https://www.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/publications/open_technology_institute_-_ntia_rfc_botnets.pdf) - including by randomizing each device's default username and password, making it much harder for hackers to locate and take over poorly configured devices. "The ability to modify login credentials should not be taken as a replacement for the implementation, where possible, of unique passwords for every device sold," OTI wrote. Also on the common-sense front, OTI said that IoT devices "must be designed in such a way that they can be patched or updated."

I wish this was the default for ANYTHING we connect to the Internet. I wish that IoT manufacturers would make this the default without the government stepping in. I'm guessing there is more money in selling insecure devices, and defending against them, then actually securing Internet connected devices in the first place. From [the number of breaches](http://breaches.apievangelist.com) I'm tracking on each week, I'm guessing business will be good for a small handful of Internet of Things manufacturers in this climate.
