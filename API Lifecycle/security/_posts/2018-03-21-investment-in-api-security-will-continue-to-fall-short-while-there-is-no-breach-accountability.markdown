<p><img src="{{ page.image }}" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>I have a lot of conversations with folks down in the trenches about API security, and what they are doing to be proactive when it comes to keeping their API infrastructure secure. The will and the desire amongst folks I talk to regarding API security is present. They want to do what it takes to truly understand what is needed to keep their APIs secure, but many have their hands tied because lack of resources to actually do what is needed. Every API team I know is short-handed, and doing the best they can with what they have available to them. A lack of investment in API security isn't always intentional, it ends up just begin a reality of the priorities on the ground within the organizations they work in.

While I'm sure leaders within these companies are concerned about breaches within their API infrastructure, the urgency to invest in this area isn't always a priority. Despite an increase in high profile, often API-induced breaches, IT and API groups are still not given the amount of resources they need to do something about potential security incidents. Other than the stress and bad press of a breach, there really are no consequences in the United States. We have seen this play out over and over, and when high profile breaches like Equifax go unpunished, other corporate leaders fully understand that there will no consequences, so why invest in preventative measures--we will just respond to it "if" it happens.

This is why GDPR, and other similar legislation will become important to the API security industry. Without real civil or criminal penalties involved with breaches, and even heavier penalties for poorly handled breaches, companies just aren't going to care. Data is just a replaceable commodity, and a company can recover from the hit to their brand when a breach does occur. Making the investment in proactive API security training, staffing, services, and processes an unnecessary thing. Reflecting how health care is handled in this country, with 95% of the investment in treating things after they happen, and about 5% investment in preventative care. Hoping all along you don't get sick, or have a breach.

I can talk until I blue in the face to business leaders about API security, and make them aware of healthy practices, but if there isn't an incentive to invest in API security, it will never happen. At this point I feel that API security is more a reflection of a wider systemic illness around how we view data, and that country and industry level policy is where change needs to occur. I will keep showcasing specific building blocks of an API security strategy, as well as showcase services and tools to help you implement your strategy, but I feel like the most meaningful change will have to occur at the policy level. Otherwise business leaders will never prioritize API security, leaving all of OUR data vulnerable to exploitation--it is just a cost of doing business at this point.
