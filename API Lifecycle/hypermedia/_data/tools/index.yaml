  description: HAL is a simple format that gives a consistent and easy way to hyperlink
    between resources in your API. Adopting HAL will make your API explorable, and
    its documentation easily discoverable from within the API itself. In short, it
    will make your API easier to work with and therefore more attractive to client
    developers. APIs that adopt HAL can be easily served and consumed using open source
    libraries available for most major programming languages. It's also simple enough
    that you can just deal with it as you would any other JSON.

    capture the functionality of hypermedia APIs, so automated agents can use them.
    Despite their powerful capabilities, RESTdesc descriptions are easy to master.
    The description is not a goal in itself: you want your API to be used. See how
    RESTdesc opens up your API for discovery, based on its functional characteristics.'
