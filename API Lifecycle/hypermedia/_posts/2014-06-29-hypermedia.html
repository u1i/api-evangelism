<h2>Hypermedia</h2>
<p>If you consider yourself an API designer in 2014, you should be familiar hypermedia, and how you can augment, and drive your API design for not just a better user experience (UX), but also a developer experience (DX).</p>
<p>As with REST, I won't be diving into the details of hypermedia design, there are plenty of resources available to teach about this, and proven examples of hypermedia used in the wild, that you can reverse engineer--my goal is to make sure you are aware of hypermedia, and its growing role in the API design process.</p>
<p>In 2014 I'm seeing a similiar uptick in hypermedia API deployments, to what I'm seeing with the overall API design space. I think hypermedia will emerge as a guiding principle in good API design, we just need the API design providers to work out the details of hypermedia integration, bake them into their API definition formats, and help API designers easily add hypermedia to their API desigin toolbox.</p>
