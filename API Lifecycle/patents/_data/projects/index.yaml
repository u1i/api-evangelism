    No matter how well designed your API is, and easy it is to get up and
    running, new users will always have questions. this is a research project,
    API(s), and tooling to help manage the frequently asked questions that
    surround API operations. It seems like a simple thing, but can go along way
    in helping making learning what an API does a lot easier.

    this I've started publishing most of my research to an API Evangelist
    spreadsheet research site, which will allow me to better track, curate, tag,
    and tell stories around spreadsheets and APIs. As I do with my 60+ API
    research projects, I will update this site when I have time, publishing
    anything I've read, written, and companies I think are doing interesting
    things spreadsheets and APIs. I'm pretty convinced that spreadsheets will be
    another one of those bridge tools we use to connect where we are going with
    APIs, with the reality of where the everyday person is, just trying to get
    their job done.

    I use screenshots across the API Evangelist network. I take screenshots of
    stories I curated, companies I track on and API developer areas I'm
    monitoring. Historically I've used a variety of screenshot APIs, to generate
    the 1000's of screenshots I need to make my network function. After test
    driving several image libraries I settled in with PhantomJS, which allows me
    to load and manipulate web pages in an object, and then take a screenshot of
    the web page in that state. I quickly wrapped in a web API using the Slim
    Framework in PHP. Once I had the API deployed I wrapped with my 3Scale API
    management infrastructure, which requires an API key before you can use any
    of my APIs. Next I updated my company, API and news screenshot tool to use
    my new screenshot API.

    This is a project to house any of my open data work around the
    explore.data.gov domain. My goal is to demonstrate to the US government what
    is possible when they provide machine readable API definitions like Swagger,
    in conjunction with API.json. When APIs are well designed, and bundled with
    machine readable defintions, and discovery documents it makes APIs much more
    usable, and remixable.

    Drones were coming up in my monitoring so much, I had to start tracking on

    dystopian universe for the whole Internet of Things API expansion. I'm
    betting that very few folks opt for API layers in their drone operations.
    Well, not APIs as we know them in the public space. They will use APIs, and
    try to remain as secretive as possible, but like many other layers of the
    IoT space, their APIs will become their achilles heel. This is purely a
    monitoring channel for me, so I can keep a close eye on the Drone space, and
    try to understand what is going on.

    I started doing research into the news space, and quickly carved off a

    specifically financial news. After I profiled the news API space I began
    doing the same for financial news providers, but quickly found that most of
    them did not meet my standard for an API. It doesn't take much to make my
    list. I showcase some pretty poor APIs, but when I started through the
    financial news API providers, more APIs got cut then made the list.

    SMS owes more to the telecom industry, and mobile phones, more than the API
    space, but when it comes to reducing valuable assets to its smallest
    possible unit of value, the SMS space is well suited for evolution via the
    API. I think think that are many lessons for API providers when it comes to
    the SMS API space, and I enjoy spending time research how companies are
    innovating when it comes to the SMS, using APIs.

    MMS for me can't be evaluated without looking at side by side with SMS. SMS
    is the evolution of messaging as a doorway to the Internet that I mention in
    my SMS research, with images, video, and audio files providing an experience
    that mobile users can access, and share with their networks. Like SMS, MMS
    is an essential compost of not just mobile, but now because of MMS APIs also
    the web, and Internet of Things experience, employing MMS as a transport.

    I find the email API space a fascinating area to research when it comes to
    APIs. If you think about it, email APIs are kind of ironic, because email is
    based upon some pretty solid standards like SMTP, POP, and IMAP, where APIs
    are nothing more than just a philosophy, and a kind of wild west when it
    comes to standardization. Yet you see some pretty interesting approaches to
    providing email infrastructure which employs, and often resemble the email
    standards, but put web APIs to work to actually do the heavy lifting.

    I have a wide range of needs to resize, crop, filter, and apply other things
    to photos I work with, as part of my storytelling, and if I had a built set
    of image manipulation APIs, life would be better--so as I do with all my
    other needs, I got to work building an API. The result is the first of a
    series of image manipulation APIs. Right now I focused on some low hanging
    fruit, like applying filters to images, which includes Charcoal, Oil
    Painting, Polaroid, and Sketch. Next, I will tackle some more utility style
    APIs like resize, crop, and rotate.

    I work witih a lot of content to make the API Evangelist network go around,
    and over time I've written a lot of scripts that harvest, and work with HTML
    pages. As with all of my work, I'm pushing to define each tool in my HTML
    toolbox into simple, easy to use APIs that I can across the network, and
    potentially others can use as well.
