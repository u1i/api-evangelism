    The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is an international non-profit
    digital rights group based in San Francisco in the United States. EFF
    provides funds for legal defense in court, presents amicus curiae briefs,
    defends individuals and new technologies from what it considers abusive
    legal threats, works to expose government malfeasance, provides guidance to
    the government and courts, organizes political action and mass mailings,
    supports some new technologies which it believes preserve personal freedoms
    and online civil liberties, maintains a database and web sites of related
    news and information, monitors and challenges potential legislation that it
    believes would infringe on personal liberties and fair use, and solicits a
    list of what it considers patent abuses with intentions to defeat those that
    it considers without merit.

  description: >-
    The Defensive Patent License (DPL) is a new legal mechanism to protect
    innovators by networking patents into powerful, mutually-beneficial legal
    shields that are 100% committed to defending innovation &ndash; no bullies,
    trolls, or other leeches allowed. It also helps prevent these actors from
    patenting open technologies and pulling them out of public use. It's a way
    for patents to be used for good, and support innovators instead of
    threatening them.

    surrounding mobile devices, and on their economic and technical
    implications. (In order to avoid conflicts of interest, Florian does not
    hold or initiate transactions in any technology stocks or derivatives

  description: >-
    The United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO or USPTO) is an agency in
    the U.S. Department of Commerce that issues patents to inventors and
    businesses for their inventions, and trademark registration for product and
    intellectual property identification. The USPTO is unique among federal
    agencies because it operates solely on fees collected by its users, and not
    on taxpayer dollars. Its operating structure is like a business in that it
    receives requests for services&mdash;applications for patents and trademark
    registrations&mdash;and charges fees projected to cover the cost of
    performing the services it provides.
