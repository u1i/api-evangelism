<p>I needed a place to keep track of all the things I will be working on around the FAFSA API project. To help me keep track as well as communicate to you, I've added a <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/fafsa-api/roadmap.html">roadmap page</a> to this project.</p>
<p>The FAFSA roadmap is generated from Github milestones, using JavaScript and the Github API.  If you'd like to see the history of work, you can look at the <a href="https://github.com/ed-data/fafsa-api/issues">issues</a> as well as the <a href="https://github.com/ed-data/fafsa-api/commits/master">commit history</a> for the FAFSA project.</p>
<p>If you have anything you'd like to see get done, you can submit as an issue and I'll either add as milestone or find other way to make sure the work gets done.</p>
