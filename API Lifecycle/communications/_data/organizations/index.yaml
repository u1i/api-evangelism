  name: Tumblr
  description: >-
    Tumblr is a re-envisioning of tumblelogging, a subset of blogging that uses
    quick, mixed-media posts. The service hopes to do for the tumblelog what
    services like LiveJournal and Blogger did for the blog. The difference is
    that its extreme simplicity will make luring users a far easier task than
    acquiring users for traditional weblogging. Anytime a user sees something
    interesting online, they can click a quick &ldquo;Share on Tumblr&rdquo;
    bookmarklet that then tumbles the snippet directly. The result is varied
    string of media ranging links and text to pictures and videos that takes
    very little time and effort to maintain.
