I have an ever growing queue of APIs and API related services that I need to play with for the first time, or just make sure and take another look at. I was FINALLY making time to take another look at the [RepreZen API Studio](https://www.reprezen.com/) again when I saw that they were now supporting OpenAPI 3.0.

I am still driving it around the block, but I thought the second email I got from them when I was signing up was worth writing about. I had received a pretty standard getting started email from them, but then I got a second email from Miles Daffin, their product manager, reminding me that I can reach out, and providing me with a "Yes I Would Like To Talk Button". I know, another pretty obvious thing, but you'd be surprised how a little thing like this can actually break us from our regular isolated workspace, and make the people behind an API, or API related service more accessible. The email was pretty concise and simple, but what caught my eye when I scanned was the button.

Anyways, just a small potential building block for your API communication strategy. I'll be adding the list I am cultivating. I'm not a big hard sell kind of guy, and I appreciate soft outreach like this--leaving it up to me when I want to connect. I'll keep playing with RepreZen API Studio and report back when I have anything worth sharing. I just wanted to make sure this type of signup email was included in my API communication research.
