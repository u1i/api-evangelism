<h2>API Evangelism</h2>
<p>An API is useless if nobody knows about it. Evangelism has emerged as the approach to selling, marketing and support an API platform. While the intent of evangelism can be sales and marketing, the philosophy that has proved successful is to find a balance that is more about focusing on API support and engagement with consumers over sales.</p>
<p>A healthy API evangelism strategy brings together a mix of business, marketing, sales and technology disciplines into a new approach to doing business.</p>
<p><strong>Goals</strong><br />Healthy API evangelism is centered around clear goals. Goals usually start with targets like new user registration, but need to be set higher around active API consumers, expanding how your existing users consume your API resources, all the way to clear definition of how your API will extend and expand your brand.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Consumer Engagement</strong><br />While it may seem obvious, actively engaging API consumers often gets lost in the shuffle. Have a strategic approach to reaching out to new users in a meaningful way, establishing healthy practices for reaching out to existing developers at various stages of integration, is essential to growing an API initiative. Without planned engagement of API consumers, a canyon will grow between API provider and API consumer, one that may never be able to be reversed.</p>
<p><strong>Blogging</strong><br />An active blog, with an RSS feed has the potential to be the face of an API and developer evangelism campaign. A blog will be the channel you tell the stories that help consumers understand the value that an API delivers, how other developers are integrating with it, ultimately leaving an SEO exhaust that will bring in new consumers. If comments are in place, a blog can also provide another channel for opening up conversation with API consumers and the public.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Landscape</strong><br />Without an understanding of the industry an API is operating in, an API will not effectively serve any business sector. By establishing and maintaining a relevant keyword list, you can monitor competitors, companies that compliment your platform, and establish an active understanding of the business sector you are trying to serve. Regular monitoring and analysis of the business landscape is necessary to tailor a meaningful API evangelism campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Support</strong><br />When it comes to evangelism, support is one of the most critical elements. There is no better word of mouth for an API, than an existing consumer talking about how good the API is, and the support. Engage and support all API consumers. This will drive other vital parts of API evangelism, including creating positive stories for the blog, healthy conversations on social networks and potentially creating evangelists within a community.</p>
<p><strong>GitHub</strong>&nbsp;<br />I recommend a lot of online services and tools for API providers and consumers to put to use. But there is not any single platform that delivers as much value to the API space as Github. I would put AWS as close second, but Github provides a wealth of resources you can tap when both providing APIs or building applications around them. &nbsp;Github is a critical piece of any API strategy, allowing social relationships with developers that is centered around code samples, libraries or even documentation and resources for an API.</p>
<p><strong>Social Networking</strong><br />Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Google+ and Github are essential to all API evangelism strategies. If an API does not have a presence on these platforms, it will miss out on a large segment of potential API consumers. Depending on the business sector an API is targeting, the preferred social network will vary. Providing an active, engaging social support presence when operating an API is vital to any API ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Social Bookmarking</strong><br />Discovery and curation of bookmarks to relevant news and information via social bookmarking platforms is essential to an active API evangelism strategy. Using Reddit, Hacker News and StumbleUpon will provide discovery and access to a wealth of resources for understanding the API space, but also provide an excellent channel for broadcasting blog posts, news and other resources about API operations, keeping consumers informed, while also opening up other opportunities for discovery.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Road-map</strong><br />API providers, and API consumers are constantly building trust and establishing a long term relationship with each other. One key facet of this trust, and the foundation for the relationship is sharing a common road-map. API providers need to actively involve API consumers with where the API resources are going, so that consumers can prepare, adjust and even give feedback that may, or may not, influence the road-map. Nothing will piss off API consumers faster than keeping them in the dark about what is coming down the pipes, and surprising them with changes or breaks in their applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Events</strong><br />A healthy online presence is critical to any successful API strategy, but giving attention to a strong in-person presence at events is also a proven tactic of successful API providers. Evangelism involves a coordinated presence at relevant conferences, hackathons and local meetups. Events are necessary for building personal relationships with partners and API consumers that can be re-enforced online.</p>
<p><strong>Reporting</strong><br />Measuring every aspect of an API operations is necessary to understand what is happening in any API operations. Reporting on every aspect of API operations is how you visualize and make sense of some often, very fast moving API activity. It is important to quantify API operations, and develop reports that are crafted to inform key stakeholders about an API initiative. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Internal</strong><br />External facing activities will dominate any active API operations. However, an essential aspect of sustainable API programs is internal evangelism. Making sure co-workers across all departments are aware and intimate with API operations, while also informing management, leadership and budget decision makers is critical to keeping API doors open, healthy and active.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Repeat</strong><br />API and developer evangelism is an iterative cycle. Successful API operations will measure, assess and plan for the road-map in an ongoing fashion, often repeating on a weekly and monthly basis to keep cycles small, reducing the potential for friction in operations and minimizing failures when they happen.</p>
<p>A healthy API evangelism strategy will be something that is owned partially by all departments in a company. IT was a silo, APIs are about interoperability internally and externally.</p>
