<h2>About API Evangelist</h2>

<p>My name is Kin Lane, and I created the API Evangelist blog, and persona, to provide me with a lens for looking at technology through. In 2010, I began studying the business of APIs, trying to understand how new waves of startups like Twilio, Stripe, SendGrid and others were building API-centric businesses. Seven years later I am still studying APIs, but I'd say my focus is more on the politics of APIs, than the technology or business of it.</p>
<p>I spend my days studying and playing with APIs, looking for new companies doing interesting things with APIs, and developing interesting solutions on top of APIs. I believe APIs have the potential to do interesting things when it comes to delivering data, content, and algorithms to web, mobile, and device-based applications. Even with this potential, I see a lot of APIs that are meh, and some that are pretty exploitative, or just really not that useful. APIs does not equal good, it is their potential that keeps my attention.</p>
<p>My website(s) are all data and API driven, running 100% on Github, as forkable, resuable modules. Every project has a YAML data store delivering data and content to humans via the website, and other applications via APIs. I study a variety of APIs from a diverse range of sectors, which I organize as <a href="http://apievangelist.com/api-stack/">my API Stack research</a>. From this work I identify the common building blocks applied in the operations of these APIs, and aggregate them as part of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/api-lifecycle/">my API lifecycle research</a>. Each area of my research will have any news and links I curate, the companies and organizations behind them, services, tools, patents, and many other interesting bits I come across.</p>
<p>My research is funded by <a href="http://apievangelist.com/partners/">my partners and sponsors</a>, with a good amount of consulting mixed in to pay the bills. Most of the time I love APIs and what they can do. Other times I'm horrified by what people are doing with Facebook and Twitter APIs, and the growing number of Internet of Things APIs. APIs are the pipes in which data, often seen as the new oil flow through. APIs are how artificial intelligence and machine learning is executed and applied. APIs are in our homes, cars, strapped to our bodies, and in our pockets on our phone. APIs are everywhere.</p>
<p>API Evangelist is my business. It is my research workbench. It is my muse for telling stories about the potential and the horror of technology. Thanks for tuning in, and supporting!</p>
