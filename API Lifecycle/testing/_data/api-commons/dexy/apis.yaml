description: Dexy helps your code to speak for itself. Show off your code with beautiful
  syntax highlighting. Write examples and Dexy will run them, inserting the output
  into any document you wish. Everything is based on live code, so updating is easy,
  syntax errors blow up on you, not your users, and typos are a thing of the past.
  With Dexy's smart caching, your code is only executed when it needs updating, saving
  you time while keeping your documents robust.
