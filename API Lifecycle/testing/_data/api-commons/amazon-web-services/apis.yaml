description: "Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for
  developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale.
  With a few clicks in the AWS Management Console, you can create an API that acts
  as a \u201Cfront door\u201D for applications to access data, business logic, or
  functionality from your back-end services, such as workloads running on Amazon Elastic
  Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), code running on AWS Lambda, or any Web application. "
