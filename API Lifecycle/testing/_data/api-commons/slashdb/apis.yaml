name: SlashDB
description: SlashDB connects your internal databases and constructs a REST/HTTP web
  service, easily making database content accessible by URLs for getting, updating,
  inserting and deleting in a secure way.  SlashDB provides connectors for Microsoft
  SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, PostGreSQL, IBM DB2 and Sybase--covering the top 5 databases
  you will find in the enterprise or small to medium businesses. SlashDB automatically
  turns databases into online resource so their content becomes accessible to authorized
  web, mobile and enterprise applications for reading and writing under standard data
  formats. Technically speaking, it makes REST APIs out of relational databases.
