I have not had much time to do performance testing on our recent <a class="zem_slink" title="Amazon EC2" rel="homepage" href="http://amazon.com">Amazon EC2</a> environment. We got our entire company migrated and stabilized in a completely <a class="zem_slink" title="Amazon Web Services" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services">Amazon Web Services</a> based environment. And so far I love it..<p></p>
So I am very thankful I came across this performance testing of different types of file system configurations setup on <a class="zem_slink" title="Amazon" rel="homepage" href="http://amazon.com/">Amazon</a> volumes.<p></p>
Checkout the <a href="http://af-design.com/blog/2009/02/27/amazon-ec2-disk-performance/">Amazon Performance Testing here</a>.<p></p>
It is very helpful to have other considering using Amazon <a class="zem_slink" title="Web service" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service">Web Services</a> and EC2 as an alternative to their current ISP or hosting provider. Helps me make better educated decisions with the limited time and resources I have.
