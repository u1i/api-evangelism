Like <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/cloud/2010/08/the-new-api-movement-may.php" target="_blank">10 Common Mistakes Made by API Providers</a> at RWW and <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2010/08/12/apis-an-important-part-of-product-strategy/" target="_blank">APIs: an Important Part of Product Strategy</a> at ProgrammableWeb.<p></p>
I had the pleasure of sitting with the engineer from <a href="http://www.mashery.com/" target="_blank">Mashery</a> a couple weeks ago and listen to their assessment of the API market. Ever since then I've been reviewing their approach to <a href="http://www.mashery.com/product/" target="_blank">API deployment</a> and working to understand the playing field better.<p></p>
Today I came across <a href="http://www.sonoasystems.com/" target="_blank">Sonoa</a> and the <a href="http://apigee.com/" target="_blank">free API</a> tools at <a href="http://apigee.com/" target="_blank">Apigee</a>. <a href="http://apigee.com/" target="_blank">Apigee</a> offers:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>API Testing</li>
	<li>API Debugging</li>
	<li>API Analytics</li>
	<li>API Protection</li>
</ul>
I'm checking out <a href="http://www.sonoasystems.com/" target="_blank">Sonoa</a> and what they offer more. I am also adding testing, debugging, and protection to my list of API building blocks.
