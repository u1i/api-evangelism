    Amazon Web Services(AWS) is a collection of remote computing services (also
    called web services) that together make up a cloud computing platform,
    offered over the Internet by Amazon.com. The most central and well-known of
    these services are Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3. The service is advertised as
    providing a large computing capacity (potentially many servers) much faster
    and cheaper than building a physical server farm.

    Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable cloud Domain Name System
    (DNS) web service. It is designed to give developers and businesses an
    extremely reliable and cost effective way to route end users to Internet
    applications by translating names like www.example.com into the numeric IP
    addresses like 192.0.2.1 that computers use to connect to each other. Amazon
    Route 53 is fully compliant with IPv6 as well. Amazon Route 53 effectively
    connects user requests to infrastructure running in AWS &ndash; such as
    Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancing load balancers, or Amazon S3
    buckets &ndash; and can also be used to route users to infrastructure
    outside of AWS. You can use Amazon Route 53 to configure DNS health checks
    to route traffic to healthy endpoints or to independently monitor the health
    of your application and its endpoints. Amazon Route 53 Traffic Flow makes it
    easy for you to manage traffic globally through a variety of routing types,
    including Latency Based Routing, Geo DNS, and Weighted Round Robin&mdash;all
    of which can be combined with DNS Failover in order to enable a variety of
    low-latency, fault-tolerant architectures. Using Amazon Route 53 Traffic
    Flow&rsquo;s simple visual editor, you can easily manage how your end-users
    are routed to your application&rsquo;s endpoints&mdash;whether in a single
    AWS region or distributed around the globe. Amazon Route 53 also offers
    Domain Name Registration &ndash; you can purchase and manage domain names
    such as example.com and Amazon Route 53 will automatically configure DNS
    settings for your domains.
