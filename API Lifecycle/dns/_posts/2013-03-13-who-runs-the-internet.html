<p>I came across the great infographic from <a href="http://www.icann.org/">ICANN</a> titled, Who Runs the Internet? &nbsp;i want to brush up on my own knowledge about all the key stakeholders in the Internet, so I typed up some of the text from the infographic, for my own benefit, as well as to make it a little more interactive.</p>
<h2>Who Runs The Internet?</h2>
<p><strong>No One Person, Company, Organization or Government Runs the Internet</strong></p>
<p>The Internet itself is a globally distributed computer network comprised of many voluntarily interconnected autonomous networks.  Similarly, its governance is conducted by a decentralized and international multi-stakeholder network of interconnected autonomous groups drawing from civil society, the private sector, governments, academic and research communities, and national and international organizations.  They work cooperatively from their respective roles to create shared policies and standards that maintain the Internet's global interoperability for the public good.</p>
<p><strong>Here is how it works:</strong></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Operations &amp; Services</strong> - Internet Operations span all aspects of hardware, software, and infrastructure required to make the Internet work.  Services include education, access, web browsing, online commerce, social networking. etc </li>
<li><strong>Policies &amp; Standards </strong>- Internet Policies are the shared priciniples, norms, rules, decision-making procedures, and programs that shape the evolution and use of the Internet.  Internet Standards enable interoperability of systems on the Internet by defining protocols, messages formats, schemas, and languages </li>
<li><strong>Open Debate </strong>- The forma and informal process of debating policy and standard propositions in a multi-stakeholder model using any variety of methods: in-person, Internet Drafts, public forums, publishing and many more </li>
<li><strong>Multi-Stakeholders</strong> - Civil Society &amp; Internet Users, the Private Sector, Governments, National &amp; Internal Organizations, Research, Academic and Technical communities all have a say in how the Internet is run </li>
</ul>
