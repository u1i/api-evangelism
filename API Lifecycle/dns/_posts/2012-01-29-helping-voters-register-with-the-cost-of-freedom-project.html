<p>The Cost of Freedom Project is centered around providing the necessary information and resources needed by U.S citizens to be able to vote in the 2012 elections, primarily targeted the 5 states that have strict laws requiring voters to show a government issued photo ID in order to vote.</p>
<p>When it comes to making a social impact, Faye&rsquo;s project is a shining example, and I couldn&rsquo;t ignore her need for a hacker to move her project forward. &nbsp;After hearing her pitch, I joined her project team which included Lori Widelitz-Cavallucci (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/lwcavallucci">@lwcavallucci</a>) a UX Designer, and Jack Aboutboul (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jackfoundation">@jackfoundation</a>), Developer Evangelist from Twilio.</p>
<p>As Lori and Faye got to work on the site layout and user experience I started setting up the back-end that would be necessary to run the app:<br /><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-532" title="my-team-presenting-at-hackathon-for-social-good-in-nyc3" src="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/my-team-presenting-at-hackathon-for-social-good-in-nyc3-300x158.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="158" align="right" /></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Amazon EC2 Instance Running Fedora Linux and Apache Web Server &nbsp;PHP 5.3</li>
<li>Twitter Bootstrap</li>
<li>DNS for Domain Setup</li>
</ul>
<p>By the end of the Hackathon we had a site layout, with all pages setup with initial content. &nbsp;All the site content is editable from a Google spreadsheet allowing Faye to maintain control over her content and crowsdsource the management of content using the spreadsheet interface.</p>
<p>The site uses CityGrid to pull vital record offices by state, county voter registration and local DMV offices when a user enters their city and zip code.</p>
<p>The Cost of Freedom Project is a great example of what you can pull together at a hackathon, but also the wide range of apps you can build using CityGrid data. &nbsp;Sites do not have to be local directories,&nbsp;<a title="CityGrid Places Data" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Places+API">CityGrid places data</a>&nbsp;can be used to build informational sites that add value to almost any process.</p>
