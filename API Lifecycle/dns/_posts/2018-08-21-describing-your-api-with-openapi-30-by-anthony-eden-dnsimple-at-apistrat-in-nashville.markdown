<p><img src="{{ page.image }}" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>We are getting closer to [the 9th edition of APIStrat happening in Nashville, TN this September 24th through 26th](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/). [The schedule for the conference is up](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/program/schedule/), along with [the first lineup of keynote speakers](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/program/keynote_speakers/), and my drumbeat of stories about the event continues here on the blog. Next up in our session lineup is _"Describing Your API with OpenAPI 3.0"_ by Anthony Eden (@aeden), DNSimple (@dnsimple) on September 25th.

Here is Christian's abstract for the session:

_For the last 10 years, DNSimple has operated a comprehensive web API for buying, connecting, and operating domain names. After hearing about OpenAPI at APIStrat 2017, we decided to describe the DNSimple API using the OpenAPI v3 specification - this is the story of why we did it, how we did it, and where we are today._

_By the end of this presentation you will have the tools you’ll need to evaluate your own API and decide if implementing OpenAPI makes sense for you, and if so, how you can get started. You’ll have a better understanding of the tools available to you to help write your OpenAPI 3 definition, as well the basics on how to write your own definition for your APIs._

We are all still working to make the switch from OpenAPI 2.0 to 3.0, and with APIStrat being owned and operated by the OpenAPI Initiative, it will definitely be the place to have face to face discussions that influence the road map for the API specification. [You can register for the event here](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/attend/register/), and there [are still sponsorship opportunities available](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/sponsor/). Don't miss out on APIStrat this year--it is going to be a good time in Nashville as we continue the conversation we started back in 2012 with the initial edition of the API industry event in New York City.

I am looking forward to seeing you all in Nashville next month!
