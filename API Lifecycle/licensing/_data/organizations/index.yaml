  description: >-
    The Defensive Patent License (DPL) is a new legal mechanism to protect
    innovators by networking patents into powerful, mutually-beneficial legal
    shields that are 100% committed to defending innovation &ndash; no bullies,
    trolls, or other leeches allowed. It also helps prevent these actors from
    patenting open technologies and pulling them out of public use. It's a way
    for patents to be used for good, and support innovators instead of
    threatening them.
