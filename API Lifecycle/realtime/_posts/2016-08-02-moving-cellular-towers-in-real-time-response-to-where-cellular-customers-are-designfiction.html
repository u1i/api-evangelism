<p>The age of the mountain top and building cellular tower is coming to a close. Our real-time cellar&nbsp;drone algorithm is now in active use in over 3300 telco fleets around the globe. After studying the daily activity of over 100 million cellular customers were able to assemble a reliable algorithm that would guide fleets of cellular network drones to where they are most needed in real time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It just didn't make sense to have cellular network towers be stationary anymore&nbsp;when our mobile users are well...mobile. We needed our cellular network to move, expand, and grow along with our user base. Thanks to advances in drone technology our network of thousands of drones deploy, hover, migrate, and return home in real time response to demands.</p>
<p>Our initial implementations were all successful due to the hard work, and quality of our algorithm, but with the data we are now receiving from the 3000 drone fleets around the globe, our new Swarm Tower (TM) technology&nbsp;is insanely precise. Rarely do we ever see a network overload or a mobile customer who cannot get the bandwidth (they are willing to pay for) they need at any given moment.</p>
<p>What has really surprised us is the use of the network beyond mobile. Early on 90% of the network connections were consumer and business smartphone devices, where now over 60% of the network capacity being&nbsp;other consumer, commercial and industrial devices. Expanding our mobile networks to meet this demand would never have been possible using traditional cell tower technology.</p>
<p>If you are as excited about Swarm Tower technology as we are, you will be interested in our Q2 announcements around secondary drone activities while they are supporting cellular network activity -- things like surveillance, weather, and other common activities.</p>
