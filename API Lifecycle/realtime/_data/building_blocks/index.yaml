    protocols for data feeds, the protocol can be applied to any data type (e.g. HTML,
    text, pictures, audio, video) as long as it is accessible via HTTP. Its main purpose
    is to provide real-time notifications of changes, which improves upon the typical
    situation where a client periodically polls the feed server at some arbitrary
    interval. In this way, PubSubHubbub provides pushed HTTP notifications without
    requiring clients to spend resources on polling for changes.

  description: The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is one of the core members of the

    formally defined in RFC 768. UDP uses a simple connectionless transmission model
    with a minimum of protocol mechanism. It has no handshaking dialogues, and thus
    exposes the user's program to any unreliability of the underlying network protocol.
    There is no guarantee of delivery, ordering, or duplicate protection. UDP provides
    checksums for data integrity, and port numbers for addressing different functions
    at the source and destination of the datagram.
