  name: AWS Kinesis Firehose
  description: Amazon Kinesis Firehose is the easiest way to load&nbsp;streaming data&nbsp;into
    AWS. It can capture, transform,&nbsp;and load streaming data into&nbsp;Amazon
    Kinesis Analytics,&nbsp;Amazon S3,&nbsp;Amazon Redshift, and&nbsp;Amazon Elasticsearch
    Service, enabling near real-time analytics with existing business intelligence
    tools and dashboards you&rsquo;re already using today. It is a fully managed service
    that automatically scales to match the throughput of your data and requires no
    ongoing administration. It can also batch, compress, and encrypt the data before
    loading it, minimizing the amount of storage used at the destination and increasing
    security. You can easily create a Firehose delivery stream from the&nbsp;AWS Management
    Console, configure it with a few clicks, and start sending data to the stream
    from hundreds of thousands of data sources to be loaded continuously to AWS &ndash;
    all in just a few minutes. With Amazon Kinesis Firehose, you only pay for the
    amount of data you transmit through the service. There is no minimum fee or setup
    cost.
