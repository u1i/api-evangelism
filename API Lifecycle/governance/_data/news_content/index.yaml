    These are the news items I've curated in my monitoring of the API space that
    have some relevance to the API governance converstation. A converstion that is still growing, but has been getting more roots lately as mainstream companies push to adopt APIs.

    If you think there is a link I should have listed here feel free to tweet it
    at me, or submit as a Github issue. Even though I do this full time, I'm
    still a one person show, and I miss quite a bit, and depend on my network to
    help me know what is going on.
