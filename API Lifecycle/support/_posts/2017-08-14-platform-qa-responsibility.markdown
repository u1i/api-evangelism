Amazon noticed that answers about their platform on Quora and Stack Exchange were usually out of date and often just plain wrong, [prompting them to launch their own QA solution](https://aws.amazon.com/answers/).

I have written about using API providers using Stack Overflow for may years now. It the last few years I've had my readers push back on this for a variety of reasons, from the Stack Overflow community being primarily a white male bro-fest, to finding things being unreliable, out of date, and often a pretty hostile and unfriendly place for people to try and learn about APIs. I'd say that I still use Stack Overflow for about 40% of my querying of API and programming related subjects, but since I'm a white male who has been doing software for 30 years, I'm a little more resistant to the bro-fest. But, I get it, and hear what  folks are saying, and get it is not always a suitable environment.

Going back and forth on this subject, I'm back in the camp where API providers should be investing in operating their own QA, FAQ, and support forums. It's definitely requires a significant amount of investment, policing, and sometimes taking stances that are unpopular, but if you are in this for the long game, it will be worth it. After watching AWS for a decade, you can see how incorrect information about your API operations can really begin to become a liability, and you might want to keep a tighter grip on where your API consumers go look for their answers. An added bonus is that you also get to set the tone for the types of questions that get answered, and the inclusiveness that will exist across your FAQ, QA, and Support.

I really need to get my core API design guides like [definitions](http://definitions.apievangelist.com/), [design](http://design.apievangelist.com/), [deployment](http://deployment.apievangelist.com/), and [management](http://management.apievangelist.com/) out the door, because I need to diving into areas like support, and gather all my thoughts regarding how API providers should be approaching this critical layer of operations. I feel like support is one of the most defining characteristics of sustainable API providers, right up there with communications I'd say. I don't care how good your API is technically, if you don't have a solid approach to supporting and communicating with your API community, I'm guessing you won't be around very long, or if you do survive, your platform will be something savvy API consumers steer clear of.
