<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/10/22/how-to-build-an-api-brand-through-consistent-storytelling/">I have written 265 separate posts, across the API Evangelist network about Swagger</a>, in the last three years. To reflect the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/">recent shift of Swagger into the&nbsp;Open API Initiative (OAI), and the specification being reborn as Open API Definition Format (OADF)</a>, I wanted to update all the stories I've told over the years, to help educate my readers of the evolution, and provide the most relevant links possible.</p>
<p>Using <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/linkrot/">my Linkrot API</a>, which helps me manage the links across my network of sites, I've identified all the pages with Swagger relevant links, and made sure they are updated to point at the most recent material. I've also added a banner to each of the 265 posts, helping educate readers who come across these posts, regarding the transition from Swagger to OADF, and help them understand where to find the latest information.</p>
<p>My network of sites is meant to be my workbench for the API space, and provide the latest information possible about what drives the API sector. It is important to me that the information is as accurate as possible, and my readers stay in tune with the shifts of the APIs space, and where they can find what they need to be successful.</p>
<p>In the end though, all of this is really just business.&nbsp;</p>
