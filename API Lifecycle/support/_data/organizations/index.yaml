    TeamSupport is a web based Customer Service & Help Desk application that is
    all about helping your business provide exceptional customer support through
    better collaboration and teamwork. Most help desk systems are best suited
    for one-on-one communications with your customers and do not focus on the
    big picture. TeamSupport is different, bringing visibility to everyone on
    your team and enabling full collaboration to solve the underlying issues. We
    strongly believe the best customer support experience is rooted in team
    collaboration. With your staff working as a team, they can easily draw on
    each other’s experience to get the best solution.

    TexTurner is The Human Translation Bot for Slack. TexTurner removes the
    bottlenecks that slow down translation jobs. Real native speakers translate
    your words into context and humanize your job, be it an email, ad copy,
    strings for an app, or even an investor deck. Whatever it is, you'll have it
    translated in 3-30 minutes by a Human. You and your team will never be lost
    in translation again. Note: Clicking the Add-to-Slack button will create a
    TexTurner account using the email address you've saved in Slack.
