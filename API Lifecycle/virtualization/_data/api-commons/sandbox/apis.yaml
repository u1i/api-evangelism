name: Sandbox
description: Quick and easy mock RESTful API and SOAP webservices. Generate from API
  definitions, instant deploy, collaborative build, and debugging tools for integration.
  Remove testing roadblocks. Close the gap that exists with incomplete or capacity
  constrained test environments. Eliminate fees for accessing third-party systems.
  Give QAs access to the exact test environment they need without delays. Streamline
  test environment provisioning time and costs.
