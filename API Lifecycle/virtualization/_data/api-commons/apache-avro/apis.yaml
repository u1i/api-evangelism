name: Apache Avro
description: Apache Avro is a data serialization system. Avro relies on schemas. When
  Avro data is read, the schema used when writing it is always present. This permits
  each datum to be written with no per-value overheads, making serialization both
  fast and small. This also facilitates use with dynamic, scripting languages, since
  data, together with its schema, is fully self-describing.
