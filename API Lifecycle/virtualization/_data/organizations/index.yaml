    Dynamically render responses using the Handlebars templating language. Craft your
    simulation using the friendly, no-code UI or go fully automated with the 100%
    WireMock-compatible API. Capture traffic to another API, then play it back from
    MockLab. Mock the unfinished parts of the API and proxy the rest straight through
    to the real thing. Test your app to destruction by injecting delays, dropped connections,
    drip-drip responses and corrupt HTTP payloads. All the power and flexibility you
    need for pain-free testing.
