    <p>This is my online domain where I work to understand the world of the Application Programming Interfaces, also known as APIs. This new way of sharing data using the web is touching almost every aspect of our increasingly digital lives, providing access to the bits and bytes that make our personal and professional worlds go round.</p>
    <p>This is my research specifically into virtualization and how it is applied to APIs and the data they serve. I am paying attention to how APIs are being mocked and virtualized, as well as how sandboxes and staging environments are being leveraged. I'm increasingly expanding this research to look at how the resources being made available via APIs are also being virtualized and templatized.</p>
    <p>API Evangelist is a network of data driven projects and APIs which I curate and manage as part of this ongoing research, hoping to provide easy access to the moving parts of my work. Everything you see here runs on Github, making everything forkable, and reusable for both humans and machines.</p>

    <p>As I keep an eye on the space I curate news, bookmark organizations, watch interesting tools, and work to understand what deployment solutions are being applied by leading API providers. I take everything I find and publish here as part of my research.</p>
    <p>I then take this research, and what I've learned and publish stories on the blog, and more long form content like my industry guides, and white papers for customers. This is one way that I generate revenue to keep it all going.</p>
    <p>If you'd like to see me focus more on API virtualization I could use more partners investing in this area, helping me find the time to study more about what is going on. Feel free to contact me directly if you want to talk more about API virtualization.</p>
    <p>Thanks for your support!</p>
