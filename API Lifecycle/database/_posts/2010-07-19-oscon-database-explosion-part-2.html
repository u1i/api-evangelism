<img class="alignnone" style="padding: 15px;" title="Schooner Information Technology" src="http://www.schoonerinfotech.com/img/logos/schooner-logo.png" alt="" width="153" height="29" align="right" />After spending some time last weekend reviewing the exhibitors at the upcoming <a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2010/" target="_blank">OSCON - Open Source Convention</a> I noticed a pattern:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>There is an explosion in database innovation right now</strong>
I listed seven separate database platforms and tools that are exhibiting at the Open Source Convention. I neglected a very notable database platform appliance company:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="http://www.schoonerinfotech.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Schooner Information Technology</strong></a>
They provide turnkey MySQL, NoSQL, and memcached appliances to work with data intensive web and social applications. I'm reviewing their two products now:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a href="http://www.schoonerinfotech.com/products/mysql_appliance" target="_blank">MySQL Appliance</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.schoonerinfotech.com/products/memcached_nosql_cache_appliance" target="_blank">Memcached/NoSQL Appliance</a></li>
</ul>
Looks like they have the solution for anyone looking to deploy MySQL or NoSQL key-value stores in their data center. I could see this being used internally or offered up as a cloud database service.
