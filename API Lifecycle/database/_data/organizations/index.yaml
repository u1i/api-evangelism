    Amazon Kinesis Firehose is the easiest way to load&nbsp;streaming
    data&nbsp;into AWS. It can capture, transform,&nbsp;and load streaming data
    into&nbsp;Amazon Kinesis Analytics,&nbsp;Amazon S3,&nbsp;Amazon Redshift,
    and&nbsp;Amazon Elasticsearch Service, enabling near real-time analytics
    with existing business intelligence tools and dashboards you&rsquo;re
    already using today. It is a fully managed service that automatically scales
    to match the throughput of your data and requires no ongoing administration.
    It can also batch, compress, and encrypt the data before loading it,
    minimizing the amount of storage used at the destination and increasing
    security. You can easily create a Firehose delivery stream from the&nbsp;AWS
    Management Console, configure it with a few clicks, and start sending data
    to the stream from hundreds of thousands of data sources to be loaded
    continuously to AWS &ndash; all in just a few minutes. With Amazon Kinesis
    Firehose, you only pay for the amount of data you transmit through the
    service. There is no minimum fee or setup cost.

    to Amazon Redshift from any of the supported sources including Amazon
    Aurora, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, SAP ASE and SQL Server, enabling
    consolidation and easy analysis of data in the petabyte-scale data
    warehouse. AWS Database Migration Service can also be used for continuous
    data replication with high-availability.

  description: >-
    Snowball is a petabyte-scale data transport solution that uses secure
    appliances to&nbsp;transfer large amounts of data&nbsp;into and out of
    the&nbsp;AWS cloud. Using Snowball addresses common challenges with
    large-scale data transfers including high network costs, long transfer
    times, and security concerns. Transferring data with Snowball is simple,
    fast, secure, and can be as little as one-fifth the cost of high-speed
    Internet. With Snowball, you don&rsquo;t need to write any code or purchase
    any hardware to transfer your data. Simply create a job in the AWS
    Management Console and a Snowball appliance will be automatically shipped to
    you*. Once it arrives, attach the appliance to your local network, download
    and run the Snowball client to establish a connection, and then use the
    client to select the file directories that you want to transfer to the
    appliance. The client will then encrypt and transfer the files to the
    appliance at high speed. Once the transfer is complete and the appliance is
    ready to be returned, the E Ink shipping label will automatically update and
    you can track the job status via&nbsp;Amazon Simple Notification Service
    (SNS), text messages, or directly in the Console. Snowball uses multiple
    layers of security designed to protect your data including tamper-resistant
    enclosures, 256-bit encryption, and an industry-standard Trusted Platform
    Module (TPM) designed to ensure both security and full chain-of-custody of
    your data. Once the data transfer job has been processed and verified, AWS
    performs a software erasure of the Snowball appliance.
