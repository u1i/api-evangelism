description: Crate is an open source, highly scalable, shared-nothing distributed
  SQL database. Crate offers the scalability and performance of a modern No-SQL database
  with the power of Standard SQL. Crate&rsquo;s distributed SQL query engine lets
  you use the same syntax that already exists in your applications or integrations,
  and have queries seamlessly executed across the crate cluster, including any aggregations,
  if needed.
