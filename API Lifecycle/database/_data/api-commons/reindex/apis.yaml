description: 'Reindex is a backend as a service for React apps. With Reindex you can
  build mobile and web apps without time consuming backend development. We provide
  the storage with a GraphQL API, so you can concentrate on shipping amazing apps
  to your users. Reindex integrates seamlessly with Relay, the JavaScript framework
  for building data-driven React applications. Together with Relay and other open
  source tools for GraphQL, Reindex provides a great developer experience: instead
  of writing complex logic for data fetching and mutations, you can write declarative
  queries and the framework handles the complex details.'
