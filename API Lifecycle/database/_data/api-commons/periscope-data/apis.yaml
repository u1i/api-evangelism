name: Periscope Data
description: Periscope plugs directly into your databases and lets you run, save,
  and share analyses over billions of data rows in seconds. By plugging into database,
  marketing and billing systems, it can show customers how email and SMS affect user
  retention; which sales channels produce the most loyal users; and how many users
  use both web and mobile frontends.
