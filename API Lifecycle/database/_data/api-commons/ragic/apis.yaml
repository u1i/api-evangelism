description: Ragic enables business people without programming skills to create cloud
  databases just like how they create a spreadsheet form. Ragic focuses on helping
  companies and teams who have outgrown their Excel files, to move on to a real database
  solution that can scale in terms of users, data relation, and data size. Users of
  Ragic are able to build their own database applications without a line of code through
  a spreadsheet interface, or install from the supplied ready-made database application
  templates across many business functions.
