  description: Unfuddle is a secure, hosted software development environment and project
    management solution for small software development teams.   Ironically, Unfuddle
    is nothing new. Project and code management tools have existed for a very long
    time. However, as a small consulting company, we have often had the opportunity
    to work with other people&#8217;s code. Despite the wide availability of some
    excellent tools (many even open source) for helping teams manage their projects,
    we have been astonished at just how bad some teams are at keeping their projects
    organized - even at the most basic level.   We know that you don&#8217;t have
    time to get a server up and running and then configure and secure code repositories,
    ticketing systems and project management tools.   Unfuddle is our way of helping
    you and your team do things right.

    as a specification for an open platform, and for general information about 311,

  name: Bontq
  description: "Bontq is for any business that needs a bug tracking and project management
    application but does not have the internal resources, or budget, for a full-blown
    application suite.  For many companies, the necessity to track bugs is often superseded
    by a lack of resources or by budgetary reasons. One option for companies in that
    situation could be to use an online service for tracking bugs. One online service
    stands out with a few extra features that make it quite useful for those tracking
    the bugs and those reporting the bugs.  Bontq is an online solution that does
    both bug tracking as well as project management. But Bontq doesn\u2019t stop there.
    This online solution also offers a client application that helps users easily
    snap and submit screenshots to aid in the bug tracking process."
