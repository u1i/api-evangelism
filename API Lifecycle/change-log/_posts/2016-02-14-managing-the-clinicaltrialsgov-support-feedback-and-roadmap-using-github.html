<p>Each of the <a href="http://adopta.agency">Adopta.Agency</a> project runs as a Github repository, with the main project site running using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. There are many reasons I do this, but one of the primary ones is that it provides me with most of what I need to provide support for the project.</p>
<p><a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll running on Github pages gives me the ability to have a blog, and manage the pages for the project</a>, which is central to support. Next I use Github Issues for everything else. If anyone needs to ask a question, make a contribution, or report a bug, they can do so using <a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/clinical-trials/issues">Github Issues for the repository</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I even drive the project road map, and change log using Github Issues. If I tag something as roadmap, <a href="http://adopta-agency.github.io/clinical-trials/roadmap/">it shows up on the road map</a>, and if I tag something as changelog, and it is a closed issue, <a href="http://adopta-agency.github.io/clinical-trials/change-log/">it will show up on the change log</a>--this is the feedback loop that will help me move the clinical trials API forward.</p>
