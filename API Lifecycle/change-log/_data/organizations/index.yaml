- slug: instagram
  name: Instagram
  description: >-
    Instagram is an online mobile photo-sharing, video-sharing and social
    networking service that enables its users to take pictures and videos, and
    share them on a variety of social networking platforms, such as Facebook,
    Twitter, Tumblr and Flickr. A distinctive feature is that it confines photos
    to a square shape, similar to Kodak Instamatic and Polaroid images, in
    contrast to the 4:3 aspect ratio typically used by mobile device cameras.
    Users can also apply digital filters to their images. The maximum duration
    for Instagram videos is 15 seconds.
