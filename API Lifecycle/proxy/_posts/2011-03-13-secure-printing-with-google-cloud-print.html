<a href="http://www.mimeo.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/mimeo-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>I've been doing a lot of work with the <a title="Google Cloud Print API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/cloudprint/docs/proxyinterfaces.html">Google Cloud Print API</a> lately.  I've built a prototype <a title="Google Cloud Print Proxy" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/02/google-cloud-print-proxy-cloud-printer/">Google Cloud Print Proxy,</a> and I am trying to push the boundaries of what can be done with Google Cloud Print.<p></p>
I'm engineering cloud print solutions for commercial printing, and along the way Im also doing a lot of research around device printing.<p></p>
When it comes to device printing I keep seeing a concept called follow me printing or <a class="zem_slink" title="Pull printing" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pull_printing">pull printing</a>.   Where you can queue up a print job from your computer, and then go to printer and print from the device.<p></p>
Think of this in terms of medical records or other secure documents.  You don't want to print down the hall, then have it take 5 minutes to walk there and get it.<p></p>
With mobile phones, and Google Cloud Printing you can have your document in Google Docs, walk to your target printer, pull out your smart phone and print your document.<p></p>
You no longer need the device have a pull printing interface.   Google Cloud Print and your mobile phone handle securely printing your documents when your ready.
