<p>We have evolved and matured beyond our early days of cloud computing. We ended up thinking that the cloud was a necessary evil, but it wasn't the early love affair with storing our lives online.</p>
<p>Today I have my own local storage nodes, where I store my photos, music, video and even my DNA sequencing. My nodes are stored on my body, in my home and secret places that only I know.</p>
<p>I can access the information on these nodes manually through physical connections or via <a href="http://telehash.org/">Telehash</a> communication chains that I've established, allowing only my nodes to talk to each other and connect to networks I've deemed acceptable.</p>
<p>When I connect one of my nodes to the cloud (which I do from time to time), I use a disposable proxy that allows me connect and transfer data, then dispose of the  device, and the address of the device that I used.  My goal is to only enter the World Wide Web via doorways that go away as soon as I'm done with them, with no trace.</p>
<p>This approach gives me the amount of control over my data that I desire, while also being able to transport information across mesh networks and even the open Internet. Disposable proxies represent the future of the Internet and how we modulate and bridge our personal and online self, in a way that gives us the highest level of control.</p>
