I have been working on my <a title="Google Cloud Print Proxy in PHP" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/02/google-cloud-print-proxy-cloud-printer/">Google Cloud Print Proxy software in PHP</a> to make available for a wider audience.<p></p>
When I get more time I intend to work on Ruby and Python versions.<p></p>
Much of the work being done with the <a title="Google Cloud Print Services Interface" href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/google/google-cloud-print-services-interface/">Google Cloud Print Services Interface</a> is being done by major printer manufacturers in private.<p></p>
I see some of this, through the conversation on the developers wiki, but they tend to not share very much<p></p>
One developer shared his new <a title="C# example for submitting a Google Cloud Print Job" href="http://pastie.org/1733781">C# example for submitting a Google Cloud Print Job</a> last night.  I wanted to share with everyone.<p></p>
