I have been studying <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/google/">Google</a> <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/cloud-computing/cloud-print/">Cloud Print</a> <a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2010/04/new-approach-to-printing.html" target="_blank">since they announced it last year</a>. Even though you don't catch me printing very often, I am fascinated by the technology and its potential.

<a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/p/cloudprint.html" target="_blank">Google Cloud Print</a> enables any <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/application/">application</a> (web, desktop, <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/mobile/">mobile</a>) on any device to print to any printer. Applications submit print jobs to the cloud print service via the <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">API</a> offered by Google.<p></p>
Google Cloud Print then sends the print job to the selected printer which the user has previously registered with the service. New printers which are called "cloud-aware" and connect directly to the cloud print service, while legacy printers will use a Google Cloud Print Proxy.<p></p>
Currently <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/p/cloudprint.html" target="_blank">Google provides a proxy that works on Windows with Google Chrome</a>. They will be supporting Mac and Linux versions in the near future.<p></p>
All of this is fascinating and I see the potential for changing how users interact with their home and office printers, and extend these printers reach on to the mobile web.<p></p>
However, I'm interested in going further with this. I'm spending time working with the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/cloudprint/docs/proxyinterfaces.html" target="_blank">Google Cloud Print Services API</a> and building a print proxy that can be used in many different situations, beyond interfacing with physical printers.
