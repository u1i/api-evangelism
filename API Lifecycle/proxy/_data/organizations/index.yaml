  name: Wiretap
  description: The one-click proxy that shows you everything. &nbsp;View HTTP request-response
    exchanges between your web or mobile app and any REST API in real-time. &nbsp;Wiretap
    is like a browser's Network Tab, but for Web and Mobile Apps. Server-to-ServerPrinting
    HTTP request and responses data to console is a thing of the past with Wiretap.
    Every single server-side programming language works with Wiretap. Mobile-to-ServerDo
    your iOS or Android apps talk to web APIs? Use Wiretap to avoid facepalming, setting
    break points, and stepping through the debugger just to figure out how a web API
    is responding. Webhook-to-ServerCreate a Wiretap connected to your server for
    Webhooks and see exactly what they're sending you. Retry requests with a single
    click, no more reproducing steps on a 3rd party service. Tunnel-to-LocalhostWiretap
    your development servers behind a firewall with tunneling. The simple desktop
    application makes setting up a Wiretap to localhost as easy as to a public host.
