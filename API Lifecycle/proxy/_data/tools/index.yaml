- slug: repose
  name: Repose
  description: Repose is an open-source platform that you can use to build stacks
    of reusable software components. These components can be leveraged by service
    developers to perform common API processing tasks. By using Repose's components
    rather than creating their own, service developers can focus on the unique features
    of their services. Repose can be used inside a service to perform API operations.
    It can also run on one or more separate servers as a proxy to one or more services.
    At its core, Repose is a proxy that allows services to use Enterprise Integration
    Patterns (EIP).
