<h2>Contributing To The Discovery Lifecycle</h2>
<p>One of the newest incentives for API providers to develop machine readable API definitions, is about API discovery. After many years of no search solution for APIs, beyond the standard API directory, we are just now beginning to see a new generation of API discovery tooling and services.</p>
<p>Together with 3Scale, I recently launched the <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> discovery format, looking to create a single API discovery framework that can live within the root of any domain. Our goal is to allow API providers to describe their APIs, providing machine readable pointers to the common building blocks of a company's API like signup, machine readable definitions, documentation, terms of service, and much, much more.</p>
<p>As we were developing APIs.json, we recognized that without a proper, distributed search engine, any machine readable API discovery formats would not be successful, and with this in mind 3Scale launched an open source API search engine, with the first implementation being <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>. As the number of APIs rapidly grows, more search solutions like APIs.io will be needed to make sure the most valuable APIs are discoverable, in real-time.</p>
<p>The future of API discovery will need more than just basic metadata to find APIs, we will need machine readable definitions that describe the API, as well as its supporting building blocks. API definitions will help automate the discovery and understanding of what value an API delivers, helping API consumers find just the API resources they need to make their applications successful.</p>
