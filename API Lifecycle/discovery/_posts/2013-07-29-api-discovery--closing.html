<h1 class="title">Finding The APIs You Need</h1>
<p>The API discovery research for this paper is much more sparse than my other areas of research. This is a new area I'm tracking on, trying to make sense of what is already happening, and attempt to formulate some thoughts on where things might go--maybe even stear in a particular direction.</p>
<p>I really don't think API discovery is going to be as difficult as many claim it will be. There are some very smart people out there, some who have experience with indexing of the web, and I really don't think indexing and providing discovery layers for APIs will be too big of a challenge.</p>
<p>Where I believe the biggest value will come, is in the niche API discovery areas or the long tail of APIs. Discovery for speciality government resources, sensors, commercial fleets and other more obscure areas that the TechCrunches of the world will overlook because they aren't as sexy.</p>
<p>In my opinion, API discovery will be half programmatic, with the creation of API resource definitions using tools like Swagger or IO Docs, allowing directories, hubs, marketplaces, IDEs and other discovery layers to find the best available APIs. The other half will be humans verifying that APIs offer value, are usable, reliable and meaningful when being applied to real world situations. Whoever can blend these two approaches, will win.</p>
<p>Much like we saw Google dominate with its PageRank, we will also see ranking solutions evolve for API discovery. API discovery ranking algorthms evolved from traditional approaches to SEO and recent approaches to social influence will emerge. There won't be a one-size-fits-all API ranking solution, many will emerge, but they will consolidate as it has done with web and social.</p>
<p>This paper will rapidly iterate, as the API discovery arena does. We are close to reaching peak API production, where there are too many APIs available, making proper discovery solutions much more critical. &nbsp;</p>
