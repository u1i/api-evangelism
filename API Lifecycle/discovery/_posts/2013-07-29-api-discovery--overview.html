<h1 class="title">Overview of API Discovery</h1>
<p>In the early days of the web API movement (2005-2010), to find APIs, you went to ProgrammableWeb, which was the only site on the web that was exclusively dedicated to web APIs. Discovery happened via the PW directory and constant stream of news and analysis from across the space.</p>
<p>ProgrammableWeb is still relevant in 2013, but as the number of APIs grows, the directory model is not meeting the demand for finding the best of breed APIs that developers are needing to build the next generation of web and mobile apps.</p>
<p>Among the API tech sector there is always discussion around the need for programatic discovery in API the API space. Something that uses a WADL-like approach to describing APIs, so that the next generation of API directories, IDEs and other systems can discover, understand, monitor and integrate with APIs--with less human involvement. In short, this vision hasn't been achieved.</p>
<p>While technologists would love for there to be the holy grail of API discovery, in reality the space is taking baby steps from API directories to API hubs or marketplaces where you can not just discover APIs, but interact and even manage API integration and usage.</p>
<p>The need for programmatic discovery, and more meaningful indexes of API resources is growing, alongside the growing number of public, but more importantly the number of private APIs. &nbsp;</p>
