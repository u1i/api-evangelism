<h2>API Discovery</h2>
<p>In the early days of the web API movement (2005-2010), to find APIs, you went to <a href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a> (PW), which was the only site on the web that was exclusively dedicated to web APIs. Discovery happened via the PW directory and constant stream of news and analysis about the space.</p>
<p>ProgrammableWeb is still relevant in 2013, but as the number of APIs grows, the directory model is not meeting the demand for finding the best of breed APIs that developers are needing to build web and mobile apps.</p>
<p>Within the API tech sector there has always discussion around the need for programmatic discovery of APIs. Something that uses a machine readable approach to describing APIs, so that the next generation of API directories, integrated development environments (IDE) and other systems can discover, understand, monitor and integrate with APIs--with less human involvement. In short, this vision has never been realized.</p>
<p>API discovery has two sides, finding the APIs you need and having your API be found. While there has been an evolution in the API discovery game, much of it is still done manually, with a lot of legwork by both API providers and consumers.</p>
<p>As we move beyond 10K public APIs in the original API directory at ProgrammableWeb, the need for solid approaches to API discovery will emerge. API discovery is the bridge between API provider and consumer.</p>
