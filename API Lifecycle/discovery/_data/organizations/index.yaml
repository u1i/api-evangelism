    AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory (Enterprise Edition),
    also known as AWS Microsoft AD, enables your directory-aware workloads and
    AWS resources to use managed Active Directory in the AWS Cloud. The
    Microsoft AD service is built on actual Microsoft Active Directory and does
    not require you to synchronize or replicate data from your existing Active
    Directory to the cloud. You can use standard Active Directory administration
    tools and take advantage of built-in Active Directory features such as Group
    Policy, trusts, and single sign-on. With Microsoft AD, you can easily
    join&nbsp;Amazon EC2&nbsp;and&nbsp;Amazon RDS for SQL Server&nbsp;instances
    to a domain, and use&nbsp;AWS Enterprise IT applications&nbsp;such
    as&nbsp;Amazon WorkSpaces&nbsp;with Active Directory users and groups.

    Hitch is a single platform to help API owners engage with and grow their API

    providers still struggle to make sure their platform is visible to the right
    audience. Once found, access is inconsistent and cumbersome and even after
    onboarding, key engagement tools are seldom available. We have put together
    a single solution that covers these three key areas.

    We launched APIHound because -like you- we depend on finding APIs to build
    cool stuff. We searched for a good API directory, but all we found were
    sites like ProgrammableWeb that have been manually collecting APIs for years
    and PublicAPIs which has a very small API database. There had to be more
    APIs out there waiting to be found. We decided it was time to bring API
    Searching into the 21st century. APIHound is continuously examining billions
    of pages to locate the best API resources. The result is that APIHound has
    uncovered over 50,000 APIs indexed, categorized, and available for
    searching. Our API list is more than 4x larger than similar sites that have
    been around for years. We are working hard to add more sites and categories
    and tune our detection and scoring strategies. Our mission is to help you
    uncover APIs that will help you build great things.

    APIs are becoming a crucial part of the Web. Unfortunately however, it
    remains very difficult to determine the location of these APIs on servers
    around the Web. The only way to discover APIs and their properties is via
    human driven search through public search engines or in hand curated API
    Directory listings. While these methods work, neither can scale to the
    potentially hundreds of thousands and millions of APIs which will be
    published over the next few years.

  description: >-
    A group to develop a mechanism for the automatic discovery of WebAPIs, by
    extending the schema.org vocabulary. Increasingly, large online platforms
    and services provide one or more Web APIs for third-party developers.
    Moreover, many companies build WebAPIs as their primary product (Email API,
    SMS API, etc.). This has resulted in an explosion of the number of WebAPIs
    in recent years. Developers spend a significant amount of time searching for
    suitable WebAPIs to meet their needs. Our intention is to work closely with
    Schema.org to define a WebAPI-specific extension and promote usage of this
    extension among API owners. In the long run, our aim is to contribute this
    extension into the core Schema.org vocabulary. To achieve these goals we are
    seeking feedback and collaboration from API owners, DX specialists, API
    description language experts and maintainers of various API catalogs.
