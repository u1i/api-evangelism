[I created a diagram of the politics of APIs sometime ago that has really held true for me](https://apievangelist.com/2014/03/17/politics-of-apis/), and is something I've continue to reference as part of my storytelling. I wanted to do a similar thing to help me evolve my notion of [API observability](https://apievangelist.com/2016/10/25/thinking-about-an-api-observability-stack/). Like the politics of APIs, observability overlaps many areas of [my API life cycle research](http://apievangelist.com/api-lifecycle/). Also like the politics of APIs, observability involves many technical, business, and legal aspects of operating a platform online today.

Here is my first draft of a Venn diagram beginning to articulate what I see as the components of API observability:

The majority of the API observability conversation in the API space currently centers around logging, monitoring, and performance--driven by internal motivations, but done in a way that is very public. I'm looking to push forward the notion of API observability to transcend the technical, and address the other operational, industry, and even regulatory concerns that will help bring observability to everyone's attention.

I do not think we should always be doing API, AI, ML and the other tech buzzwords out there if we do not have to--saying no to technology can be done. In the other cases where the answer is yes, we should be doing API, AI, and ML in an observable way. This is my core philosophy. The data, content, algorithms, and networks we are exposing using APIs, and using across web, mobile, device, and network applications should be observable by internal groups, as well as partners, and public stakeholders as it makes sense. There will be industry, community, and regulatory benefits for sectors that see observability as a positive thing, and go beyond just the technical side of observability, and work to be more observable in all the areas I've highlight above.
