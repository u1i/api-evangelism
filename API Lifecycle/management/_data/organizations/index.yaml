After the AWS resources are deployed, you can modify and update them in a controlled and predictable way, in effect applying version control to your AWS infrastructure the same way you do with your software. You can also visualize your templates as diagrams and edit them using a drag-and-drop interface with the\_AWS CloudFormation Designer.

    The AWS CloudHSM service helps you meet corporate, contractual and
    regulatory compliance requirements for data security by using dedicated
    Hardware Security Module (HSM) appliances within the AWS cloud. With
    CloudHSM, you control the encryption keys and cryptographic operations
    performed by the HSM. AWS and AWS Marketplace partners offer a variety of
    solutions for protecting sensitive data within the AWS platform, but for
    applications and data subject to rigorous contractual or regulatory
    requirements for managing cryptographic keys, additional protection is
    sometimes necessary. Until now, your only option was to store the sensitive
    data (or the encryption keys protecting the sensitive data) in your
    on-premises datacenters. Unfortunately, this either prevented you from
    migrating these applications to the cloud or significantly slowed their
    performance. The AWS CloudHSM service allows you to protect your encryption
    keys within HSMs designed and validated to government standards for secure
    key management. You can securely generate, store, and manage the
    cryptographic keys used for data encryption such that they are accessible
    only by you. AWS CloudHSM helps you comply with strict key management
    requirements without sacrificing application performance. The AWS CloudHSM
    service works with Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). CloudHSM instances
    are provisioned inside your VPC with an IP address that you specify,
    providing simple and private network connectivity to your Amazon Elastic
    Compute Cloud (EC2) instances. Placing CloudHSM instances near your EC2
    instances decreases network latency, which can improve application
    performance. AWS provides dedicated and exclusive (single tenant) access to
    CloudHSM instances, isolated from other AWS customers. Available in multiple
    Regions and Availability Zones (AZs), AWS CloudHSM allows you to add secure
    and durable key storage to your applications.

    Fishbowl Inventory is an inventory management system for small and
    medium-sized businesses. It is fully compatible with QuickBooks accounting
    software, and it is the most-requested application by QuickBooks users.
    Fishbowl helps companies track product manufacturing, movement, location and
    sales to increase efficiency and reduce supply-chain problems. It improves
    inventory accuracy through barcode software and hardware.  Fishbowl
    Manufacturing helps manufacturers create multilevel bills of materials and
    work orders. Fishbowl Mobile Warehouse lets wholesalers, distributors and
    retailers pick, pack and ship products quickly. It also allows them to
    constantly update their database so they know how much inventory they have
    on hand and when they need to order more.  Fishbowl Inventory is a private
    company based in Orem, Utah. Many of its clients use its software in
    conjunction with their existing accounting software, such as QuickBooks. But
    others, such as Boeing, NASA and the U.S. Army, use Fishbowl Inventory as a
    standalone inventory management tool.
