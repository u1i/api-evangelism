name: deployd
description: An open source platform. Design, build, and scale APIs for web and mobile
  apps in minutes instead of days. 1) No boilerplate. With one command, your API is
  up and running. It's an empty canvas waiting for you to add Resources. No boilerplate
  code necessary. 2) Resources - Deployd APIs are built of plug-and-play resources,
  such as Collection, which can easily be added and defined through the deployd dashboard.
  3) Dashboard - Add and manage your API's resources through an intuitive web-based
  dashboard. 4) 1-step deploy - When it's time to deploy, easily deploy it yourself
  anywhere that can host a Node.js app and MongoDB.
