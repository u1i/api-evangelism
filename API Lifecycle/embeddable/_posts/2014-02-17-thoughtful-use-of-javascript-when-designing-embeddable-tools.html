<p>One of the security blogs I follow is <a href="https://www.schneier.com/" target="_blank">Schneier on Security</a> from Bruce Schneier. If you want to understand what is going on around the NSA and security, Bruce is the guy. I was tweeting out a story from his blog today and noticed his share buttons:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.schneier.com/" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/schneier-on-security/schneier-on-security-javascript-share-2.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>You have to actually enable the buttons before you can click, protecting you from the common monitoring we face everyday through JavaScript. It is a simple, but very powerful concept when thinking about how we use JavaScript.</p>
<p>This approach represents a very thoughtful use of JavaScript, something I would like to do more of, and is something we should all be doing as we are building embeddable JavaScript tools.</p>
<p>Thanks Bruce!</p>
