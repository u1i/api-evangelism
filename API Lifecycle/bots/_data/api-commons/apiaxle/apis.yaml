name: ApiAxle
description: "ApiAxle is a proxy that sits on your network, in front of your API(s)
  and manages things that you shouldn't have to, like rate limiting, authentication
  and caching. It's fast, open and easy to configure.  ApiAxle is different to the
  cloud based services such as Mashery in that it\u2019s intended to be installed
  within your LAN and be managed by you. This means you own your users, you own your
  data and you can more easily manage costs. ApiAxle is open-source. This means you
  can modify it as much as you like and contribute changes back. Others will do the
  same and gradually the system will become all the better for it."
