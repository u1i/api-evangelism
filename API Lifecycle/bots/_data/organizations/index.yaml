    scans all the URLs, Files and IP addresses on the channels, groups and private
    messages in the background. It alerts users of malicious URL/files before the

    the operating system for businesses. It is not just a collaboration tool. It is

    the tweets, news articles of their interest, automate their processes etc. With
    this level of content flowing into Slack from users and also automated sources,
    there is no security on the content today. The content can be malicious and then
    end up spreading across your organization very quickly.  Take an example \u2013
    you have subscribed to feed for competitive white papers with a pattern match
    which gets delivered into Slack via an email or some other integration. This trigger
    results in a malicious file getting delivered to your Slack channel or a URL which

    the service, or even download notifications for specific users. As a project manager,
    you would probably want to receive real-time notifications when a tester you invited
    has downloaded your app, or when a new version has been made available for download.
    As a developer, you may want to receive real time notifications when your app
    crashed, with an attachment of the recorded session. A record session is information
    including the video, cpu/memory metrics, application logs and plenty of other
    stuff. User feedbacks are relevant to anyone in the team. For every new feedback
    (tester shakes a device, provides textual feedback, or sketches a screenshot)
    you will be notified, with all relevant information, and most important, the video
    that shows what exactly happened before your user complained.

    assets without leaving Slack. Whether you install just one of these apps, or you
    use them both in harmony, &nbsp;the Event Feed integration and Brandbot are guaranteed
    to give you more control over your brand. The Brandfolder Event Feed takes the
    best of Brandfolder\u2019s analytics and puts it right into your Slack channel,
    so you can see all activity in real-time. This helps you keep tabs on your brand
    by monitoring how each asset is being used, and who\u2019s using it. Brandbot
    makes it easy to collaborate on brand assets directly in Slack. Simply mention
    Brandbot with what you\u2019re looking for to quickly access the assets in your
    Brandfolder. Brandbot can also detect any file you uploaded and ask if you\u2019d
    like to send it to Brandfolder. Need help? Simply type @brandbot help. Here are
    some screenshots of the two apps in action: https://brandfolder.com/blog/shared-story/brandfolder-for-slack/"

    1-on-1 chats, and emails keep you on top of everything that\u2019s important.
    But as your team grows, communication becomes exponentially more difficult. Decisions
    are trapped in email threads where no-one can see them. It\u2019s hard to know
    where to go to get feedback. Company-wide emails become a nuisance. Chat is great
    for quick, transactional communication. But thought-out write-ups and threaded
    discussions are where the real communication gets done that's keep everyone on
    the same page. This \u201Clow-gear\u201D style of communication is crucial to
    coordinating and setting a vision for high impact projects. Tettra is a company
    wiki, built on Slack. It helps your team stay up to date on what's happening and

  name: MeisterTask (Slackbot)
  description: 'Our Slack integration is bi-directional: the inbound integration sends
    messages to a Slack channel whenever a task is created or dropped in a section
    (lane) in MeisterTask, whereas the outbound integration lets you insert tasks
    into a MeisterTask project directly from a Slack channel.    Using our Section
    Actions feature, project administrators can set up rules to send messages to a
    specific Slack channel whenever users move a task into a section, or create it
    there. The messages include all required metadata such as title, description,
    assignee as well as a link back to the task in MeisterTask. This is very useful
    for keeping team members informed about e.g. a new feature that is ready for review
    (i.e. has been moved to the Review lane), or a bug that has been fixed.   In the
    other direction, users can add tasks to a MeisterTask project directly from a
    Slack channel, including description, tags and assignee. On setup, the admin connects
    a Slack channel with a MeisterTask project and section. Using a simple syntax,
    users can then post new tasks / bugs / feature ideas directly from that channel.
    A confirmation message will be shown on the Slack channel after creation of the
    task and the task in MeisterTask will contain a link back to the exact point in
    the Slack conversation where it was created from.  Syntax and Example: ``` /mt
    task title[: description][@assignee][@watcher][+checklist item][+checklist item]
