    APIMATIC is an automatic SDK generator for Hypermedia APIs. Providing SDKs
    or client libraries not only reduces the time required for your customers to
    begin consuming your API, but also provides competitor advantage by
    targeting the variety of programming languages. While the market pressures
    you to release early and release often, you will often find yourself
    constrained with respect to time and resources. As a result, maintaining
    SDKs becomes untenable which ends up becoming a support nightmare.

    build servers. CodeBuild scales continuously and processes multiple builds
    concurrently, so your builds are not left waiting in a queue. You can get
    started quickly by using prepackaged build environments, or you can create
    custom build environments that use your own build tools. With CodeBuild, you
    are charged by the minute for the compute resources you use.

    Pipeline helps you easily create complex data processing workloads that are
    fault tolerant, repeatable, and highly available. You don&rsquo;t have to

    or creating a failure notification system. AWS Data Pipeline also allows you
    to move and process data that was previously locked up in on-premise data
    silos.
