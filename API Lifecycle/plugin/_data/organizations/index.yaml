    APIMATIC is an automatic SDK generator for Hypermedia APIs. Providing SDKs
    or client libraries not only reduces the time required for your customers to
    begin consuming your API, but also provides competitor advantage by
    targeting the variety of programming languages. While the market pressures
    you to release early and release often, you will often find yourself
    constrained with respect to time and resources. As a result, maintaining
    SDKs becomes untenable which ends up becoming a support nightmare.
