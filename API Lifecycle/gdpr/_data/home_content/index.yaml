    <p>This is my online domain where I work to understand the world of the
    Application Programming Interfaces, also known as APIs. This new way of
    sharing data using the web is touching almost every aspect of our
    increasingly digital lives, providing access to the bits and bytes that make
    our personal and professional worlds go round.</p>

    <p>This is my research specificially into the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) being implemented in Europe. This is a concept that impacts the world of APIs, and APIs play a significant role in, making it something I want to be aware of. I'm hoping to better understand what is happening in hopes of helping play a role in moving forward the conversation in Europe, as well as other countries and jurisdictions.</p>

    <p>API Evangelist is a network of data driven projects and APIs which I
    curate and manage as part of this ongoing research, hoping to provide easy
    access to the moving parts of my work. Everything you see here runs on
    Github, making everything forkable, and resuable for both humans and
    machines.</p>

    <p>As I keep an eye on the space I curate news, bookmark organizations,
    watch interesting tools, and work to understand what deployment solutions
    are being applied by leading API providers. I take everything I find and
    publish here as part of my research.</p>

    <p>I then take this research, and what I've learned and publish stories on
    the blog, and more long form content like my industry guides, and white
    papers for customers. This is one way thtat I generate revenue to keep it
    all going.</p>

    <p>If you'd like to see me focus more on API management I could use more
    partners investing in this area, helping me find the time to study more
    about what is going on. Feel free to contact me directly if you want to talk
    more about API management.</p>

    <p>Thanks for your support!</p>
