name: RAML
description: RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML) is a simple and succinct way of
  describing practically-RESTful APIs. It encourages reuse, enables discovery and
  pattern-sharing, and aims for merit-based emergence of best practices. The goal
  is to help our current API ecosystem by solving immediate problems and then encourage
  better API patterns. RAML is built on broadly-used standards such as YAML and JSON
  and is a non-proprietary, vendor-neutral open spec.
