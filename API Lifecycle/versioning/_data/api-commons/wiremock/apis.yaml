name: WireMock
description: "WireMock is a flexible library for stubbing and mocking web services.
  Unlike general purpose mocking tools it works by creating an actual HTTP server
  that your code under test can connect to as it would a real web service. It supports
  HTTP response stubbing, request verification, proxy/intercept, record/playback of
  stubs and fault injection, and can be used from within a unit test or deployed into
  a test environment. Although it\u2019s written in Java, there\u2019s also a JSON
  API so you can use it with pretty much any language out there."
