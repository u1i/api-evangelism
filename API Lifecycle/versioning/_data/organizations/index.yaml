    Onboarding new customers, and rolling out new services and products to
    existing customers, often involves integrating the customers IT systems via
    the organisation's APIs and XML channels. Customer portals from Nomos make
    this process smoother by providing an interactive means for customers to
    understand and uncover the business policies that they must comply with. The
    portals are also used to troubleshoot problems when automated requests from
    customers fail.&nbsp;

    Mockaroo lets you generate up to 1,000 rows of realistic test data in CSV,
    JSON, SQL, and Excel formats. &nbsp;If you're developing an application,
    you'll want to make sure you're testing it under conditions that closely
    simulate a production environment. In production, you'll have an army of
    users banging away at your app and filling your database with data, which
    puts stress on your code. If you're hand-entering data into a test
    environment one record at a time using the UI, you're never going to build
    up the volume and variety of data that your app will accumulate in a few
    days in production. Worse, the data you enter will be biased towards your
    own usage patterns and won't match real-world usage, leaving important bugs
    undiscovered.

    WireMock is a flexible library for stubbing and mocking web services. Unlike
    general purpose mocking tools it works by creating an actual HTTP server
    that your code under test can connect to as it would a real web service. It
    supports HTTP response stubbing, request verification, proxy/intercept,
    record/playback of stubs and fault injection, and can be used from within a
    unit test or deployed into a test environment. Although it&rsquo;s written
    in Java, there&rsquo;s also a JSON API so you can use it with pretty much
    any language out there.
